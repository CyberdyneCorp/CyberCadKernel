## Requirements
### Requirement: Native planar-faced boolean (fuse / cut / common)

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, op)` — `op = 0` fuse (`A ∪ B`),
`op = 1` cut (`A − B`), `op = 2` common (`A ∩ B`) — NATIVELY when BOTH operands are native
solids whose every face is a `FaceSurface` of kind `Plane` (polyhedra: boxes, prisms, convex
or simple-concave). The builder SHALL: (1) compute the **face–face intersection segments**
between the two solids (each planar face pair's supporting-plane line clipped to both face
polygons); (2) **split** each face along the segments crossing it into face fragments;
(3) **classify** each fragment as INSIDE / OUTSIDE / ON the other solid by a
point-in-polyhedron test at the fragment's interior centroid; (4) select the **surviving**
fragments per the op's face-survival rule (fuse: `A` outside `B` + `B` outside `A`; cut: `A`
outside `B` + `B` inside `A` reversed; common: `A` inside `B` + `B` inside `A`), orient them
outward, and **sew/heal** them into one closed watertight `Solid`. The result SHALL be a
native `topology::Shape` of type `Solid`, watertight (every edge shared by exactly two faces),
and its enclosed volume SHALL equal the exact set-algebra value for the op. On axis-aligned
box cases the native result SHALL match the OCCT oracle EXACTLY (fp64). This builder SHALL
remain OCCT-free and host-buildable and SHALL reference no OCCT / `IEngine` / `EngineShape`
type.

#### Scenario: Axis-aligned box fuse is a watertight solid with exact union volume (host)
- GIVEN two overlapping axis-aligned boxes `A` and `B`, both native planar solids, built on the host with no OCCT
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 0)` (fuse) is computed and the result is tessellated by `src/native/tessellate`
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` (`boundaryEdgeCount == 0`) with every edge shared by exactly two faces AND its enclosed volume SHALL equal `|A| + |B| − |A ∩ B|` exactly within fp64 tolerance

#### Scenario: Axis-aligned box cut is a watertight solid with exact difference volume (host)
- GIVEN two overlapping axis-aligned boxes `A` and `B`, both native planar solids, built on the host with no OCCT
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 1)` (cut, `A − B`) is computed and tessellated
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight closed 2-manifold `Solid` AND its enclosed volume SHALL equal `|A| − |A ∩ B|` exactly within fp64 tolerance

#### Scenario: Axis-aligned box common is a watertight solid with exact intersection volume (host)
- GIVEN two overlapping axis-aligned boxes `A` and `B`, both native planar solids, built on the host with no OCCT
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 2)` (common, `A ∩ B`) is computed and tessellated
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight closed 2-manifold `Solid` AND its enclosed volume SHALL equal `|A ∩ B|` exactly within fp64 tolerance

#### Scenario: A prism / simple-concave planar boolean is watertight with exact volume (host)
- GIVEN a planar prism or simple-concave polyhedron combined with another planar solid (e.g. an L-prism cut by a box, or a convex fuse), built on the host with no OCCT
- WHEN the corresponding `cc_boolean` op is computed and tessellated
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` AND its enclosed volume SHALL equal the exact set-algebra value for the op

### Requirement: Mandatory boolean self-verify guard (discard and fall through)

The engine SHALL accept a native boolean result as native ONLY when it PASSES a mandatory
self-verify: the candidate SHALL be (a) a **closed watertight 2-manifold** (closed at every
deflection in the mesher's deflection ladder, positive enclosed volume) AND (b) have the
**correct set-algebra volume sign and magnitude** for the op. For a PLANAR-faced boolean the
candidate volume `Vr` SHALL satisfy `Vr ≈ |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B|` (fuse), `Vr ≈ |A| − |A ∩ B|`
(cut), or `Vr ≈ |A ∩ B|` (common) within a fp-exact relative tolerance, using the operands'
native volumes and their native intersection volume. For an AXIS-ALIGNED box-cylinder
boolean the operand volumes are ANALYTIC, so the candidate volume `Vr` SHALL satisfy
`Vr ≈ boxVol − π·r²·h` (cut through-hole), `Vr ≈ boxVol + π·r²·h_boss − π·r²·h_overlap`
(fuse boss), or `Vr ≈ π·r²·h_overlap` (common) within a RELATIVE tolerance sized to the
curved-face tessellation deflection (curved faces are deflection-bounded, not fp-exact). If
EITHER check fails, the engine SHALL **DISCARD** the native result. The engine SHALL NEVER
emit an unverified, leaky, or wrong boolean solid; when both operands are native and the
candidate is discarded (or the builder declines), the engine SHALL report an honest error
rather than hand a native void to OCCT (which cannot read it).

#### Scenario: A bad native boolean result is discarded (host)
- GIVEN a native boolean candidate that is open / non-manifold OR has a wrong set-algebra volume for its op (planar or analytic-curved), built on the host
- WHEN the self-verify guard is applied
- THEN the guard SHALL reject the candidate AND the engine SHALL NOT emit a leaky or wrong solid (a native-native case reports an honest error; a case with an OCCT operand falls through to OCCT)

#### Scenario: A bad analytic-curved candidate is discarded by the analytic-volume oracle (host)
- GIVEN a native axis-aligned box-cylinder boolean candidate whose enclosed volume is outside the analytic band for its op (`boxVol − π·r²·h` cut / `boxVol + π·r²·h_boss − overlap` fuse / `π·r²·h_overlap` common), built on the host
- WHEN the self-verify guard is applied
- THEN the analytic-volume oracle SHALL reject the candidate AND no native curved result SHALL be emitted

#### Scenario: A verified native boolean is read back by the native paths (host)
- GIVEN a native boolean result (planar or analytic-curved box-cylinder) that PASSES the self-verify (watertight 2-manifold with the correct set-algebra / analytic volume)
- WHEN its mass properties, bounding box, sub-shape ids, and tessellation are queried
- THEN they SHALL be served by the native body-consuming paths with no fallback call

### Requirement: Curved-face, near-degenerate, and non-native boolean cases fall through to OCCT

The native boolean builder SHALL DECLINE (return a NULL `Shape`) for any case outside the
supported native domain (the planar-polyhedron slice AND the axis-aligned box-cylinder
analytic slice): (1) either operand has a **sphere, cone, or NURBS / free-form face**
(`FaceSurface::kind` `Sphere` / `Cone` / `BSpline` / `Bezier`); (2) a **NON-axis-aligned
cylinder** (its axis not parallel to a box axis — the plane-cylinder trace would be a general
ellipse / conic, not a circle / line); (3) a **cylinder-cylinder** pair (any orientation —
a surface-surface intersection curve); (4) any other **general curved** configuration outside
the axis-aligned box-cylinder family; (5) a **near-tangent / coincident-curved / degenerate**
configuration (a cylinder tangent to a box face, a coincident axis / radius, a cap plane
coincident with a cylinder end, a sliver trace, a fragment interior point near-ON the other
solid, touching-only measure-zero contact, or a self-intersecting / open / zero-volume
operand); (6) either operand is **not a native body** (a foreign / OCCT-built shape id). When
either operand is an OCCT body, each such case SHALL produce EXACTLY the fallback (OCCT)
engine's result; when both operands are native voids OCCT cannot read, the engine SHALL report
an honest error (never a faked or misread result). The change SHALL NOT fake, stub-out, or
partially implement any deferred case; each SHALL be labelled and verified as a fall-through,
never faked. The already-native axis-aligned box-cylinder cut / fuse / common (the new curved
slice) is EXCLUDED from this fall-through — it is computed natively.

#### Scenario: A sphere or cone operand falls through / declines (host + parity)
- GIVEN a boolean where at least one operand has a sphere or cone face, with the native engine active (`cc_set_engine(1)`)
- WHEN `cc_boolean` is invoked
- THEN the native builder SHALL return a NULL `Shape` AND (with an OCCT operand) the result SHALL be identical to invoking the same call with the OCCT engine active (`cc_set_engine(0)`), proving fall-through with no native interception

#### Scenario: A non-axis-aligned cylinder or cylinder-cylinder pair falls through (host + parity)
- GIVEN a boolean whose cylinder axis is NOT parallel to a box axis, OR two cylinders, with the native engine active
- WHEN `cc_boolean` is invoked
- THEN the native curved builder SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (the trace is not a circle / line, or there is no box operand) AND the result SHALL be the OCCT oracle's under `cc_set_engine(0)`, proving fall-through

#### Scenario: A near-tangent / coincident-curved configuration declines (host)
- GIVEN an axis-aligned box-cylinder configuration in a near-tangent / coincident-curved state (cylinder tangent to a box face, coincident axis / radius, or a sliver trace), with the native engine active
- WHEN `cc_boolean` is invoked
- THEN the native builder SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (rather than emit a wrong classification) AND the engine SHALL NOT emit a native result for that call

#### Scenario: A non-native (foreign) operand falls through (host)
- GIVEN a `cc_boolean` where at least one operand is not a native body (a foreign / OCCT-built shape id), with the native engine active
- WHEN `cc_boolean` is invoked
- THEN `NativeEngine` SHALL fall through to the fallback engine for that call (a native boolean requires the native B-rep of both operands), identical to `cc_set_engine(0)`

### Requirement: NativeEngine computes the boolean natively, else falls through

`NativeEngine` SHALL override `boolean_op` to run the native builder in `src/native/boolean/`
when BOTH operands are native bodies and apply the mandatory self-verify guard, type-erasing a
verified native `topology::Shape` into a tracked native `EngineShape`. When either operand is
not native, when the native builder returns a NULL `Shape` (a curved / coincident / degenerate
DECLINE), or when the self-verify guard rejects the candidate, the override SHALL fall through
to the held fallback engine with **no native interception**, producing exactly the fallback's
result. OCCT SHALL be referenced ONLY under `CYBERCAD_HAS_OCCT` (in the fallback wiring); the
native builder SHALL reference no OCCT / `IEngine` / `EngineShape` type. No `cc_*` signature or
POD layout SHALL change and the default engine SHALL remain OCCT (opt-in via `cc_set_engine(1)`).

#### Scenario: A supported planar boolean is built natively and read back natively
- GIVEN a `NativeEngine` active (`cc_set_engine(1)`) and two native planar-faced solids in a supported (non-coincident) configuration
- WHEN `cc_boolean(a, b, op)` is invoked for any op (fuse / cut / common)
- THEN the shape SHALL be built by `src/native/boolean/` and PASS the self-verify with no fallback call AND its mass properties / bbox / sub-shape counts / watertight tessellation SHALL be served by the native paths

#### Scenario: An unsupported or unverified boolean falls through under the native engine
- GIVEN the native engine active and an input hitting a deferred case (curved-face operand, near-tangent / coincident configuration, foreign operand) OR a candidate that fails the self-verify
- WHEN `cc_boolean` is invoked
- THEN the native builder SHALL return NULL (or the guard SHALL reject) AND the result SHALL be identical to invoking the same call with the OCCT engine active (`cc_set_engine(0)`), proving fall-through with no native interception

### Requirement: Boolean parity with OCCT through the facade (simulator gate)

The change SHALL be verified on a booted iOS simulator (OCCT linked): the SAME `cc_boolean`
calls SHALL be issued once with the native engine active (`cc_set_engine(1)`) and once with the
OCCT default (`cc_set_engine(0)`), and the two resulting shapes SHALL be compared through the
`cc_*` facade — mass properties, bounding box, sub-shape counts, and watertight tessellation —
against the OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_Fuse` / `_Cut` / `_Common` oracle. On **axis-aligned box** fuse /
cut / common (the planar slice) the native result SHALL match the oracle EXACTLY (relative
error ~0, fp precision). On **axis-aligned box-cylinder** fuse / cut / common (the new curved
slice) the native result SHALL match the oracle within the curved-face DEFLECTION bound
(analytic volume ~exact, curved faces `Cylinder` surfaces, watertight). The fall-through cases
(a sphere / cone operand, a non-axis-aligned cylinder, a cylinder-cylinder pair, a NURBS
operand, and a near-tangent / coincident-curved configuration) SHALL be asserted identical
under both engines (fall-through proof, the OCCT path owning both voids). The parity test SHALL
restore the OCCT default in teardown and SHALL carry its own `main()` (on the
`run-sim-suite.sh` SKIP list) so the 221-assertion suite count is unchanged.

#### Scenario: Native box booleans match the OCCT BRepAlgoAPI oracle exactly (parity)
- GIVEN axis-aligned box fuse / cut / common cases (planar) on a booted iOS simulator
- WHEN each `cc_boolean` op is called with the native engine active and with the OCCT default
- THEN the two shapes' mass properties, bounding box, sub-shape counts, and watertightness SHALL agree EXACTLY (relative error ~0) with the OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI` oracle

#### Scenario: Native box-cylinder booleans match the OCCT oracle within the deflection bound (parity)
- GIVEN axis-aligned box-cylinder cut (round hole) / fuse (round boss) / common cases on a booted iOS simulator
- WHEN each `cc_boolean` op is called with the native engine active and with the OCCT default
- THEN the two shapes' mass properties (analytic volume ~exact) and watertightness SHALL agree within the curved-face deflection bound with the OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI` oracle

#### Scenario: Curved fall-through boolean cases are identical under both engines (parity)
- GIVEN a sphere / cone boolean, a non-axis-aligned cylinder boolean, a cylinder-cylinder boolean, a NURBS boolean, and a near-tangent / coincident-curved boolean on a booted iOS simulator
- WHEN each is called with the native engine active and with the OCCT default
- THEN the two results SHALL be identical (the native engine intercepts none of them)

#### Scenario: Existing suites stay green at the OCCT default
- GIVEN this change applied on an OCCT build with the engine left at its default
- WHEN `scripts/run-sim-suite.sh`, host CTest (including the planar `test_native_boolean`), and the GPU / Phase-3 suites are run
- THEN all SHALL stay green (`run-sim-suite.sh` 221/221) with no behavioural change from before this change

### Requirement: Native axis-aligned box-cylinder boolean (fuse / cut / common)

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, op)` — `op = 0` fuse (`A ∪ B`,
round boss), `op = 1` cut (`A − B`, round hole), `op = 2` common (`A ∩ B`) — NATIVELY when
one operand is a native **axis-aligned box** (six planar axis-aligned faces) and the other
is a native **cylinder solid** (one `FaceSurface::Kind::Cylinder` lateral face + two planar
`Plane` caps bounded by `Circle` edges) whose **axis is parallel to a box axis** (and to a
world axis). The builder SHALL use the **analytic plane-cylinder intersection**: a box face
**perpendicular** to the cylinder axis SHALL trace a `Circle` on the cylinder (splitting the
box face into an outer loop with an inner circular hole, and capping the cylinder there with
a `Plane` disk bounded by that `Circle`); a box face **parallel** to the axis SHALL trace
axial `Line` rulings (splitting the cylindrical lateral face into angular fragments and the
box face along the chord). The intersection curves SHALL be kept as TRUE `Circle` / `Line`
`EdgeCurve`s in the B-rep (curved faces chorded only at tessellation, deflection-bounded —
never a chord polyline in the B-rep). The builder SHALL classify each fragment as INSIDE /
OUTSIDE / ON the other solid by a point-in-solid test (`dist_to_axis ≤ r` within the axial
span for the cylinder; six half-spaces for the box), select the **surviving** fragments per
the op (fuse: box outside cyl + cyl outside box; cut: box outside cyl + cyl-lateral inside
box REVERSED + entry/exit cap disks; common: box inside cyl + cyl inside box), orient them
outward, and **heal** the shared `Circle` / `Line` seams into one closed watertight `Solid`.
The result SHALL be a native `topology::Shape` of type `Solid`, watertight (every edge shared
by exactly two faces, `boundaryEdgeCount == 0`), with its curved faces `Cylinder` surfaces
and its curved seam edges `Circle` curves; its enclosed volume SHALL equal the exact analytic
set-algebra value for the op (`boxVol − π·r²·h` cut / `boxVol + π·r²·h_boss − overlap` fuse /
`π·r²·h_overlap` common) within the curved-face deflection bound. On the axis-aligned
box-cylinder case the native result SHALL match the OCCT oracle (analytic volume ~exact,
curved faces deflection-bounded). This builder SHALL remain OCCT-free and host-buildable and
SHALL reference no OCCT / `IEngine` / `EngineShape` type.

#### Scenario: A round hole (cut) through a box is a watertight solid with exact analytic volume (host)
- GIVEN an axis-aligned box `A` and an axis-parallel through-cylinder `B` (radius `r`, height `h` spanning the box), both native, built on the host with no OCCT
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 1)` (cut, `A − B`) is computed and tessellated by `src/native/tessellate`
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` (`boundaryEdgeCount == 0`) whose lateral tunnel wall is a `Cylinder` face bounded by `Circle` edges AND its enclosed volume SHALL equal `boxVol − π·r²·h` within the curved-face deflection bound

#### Scenario: A round boss (fuse) on a box is a watertight solid with exact analytic volume (host)
- GIVEN an axis-aligned box `A` and an axis-parallel cylinder `B` (a boss standing on a box face), both native, built on the host with no OCCT
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 0)` (fuse, `A ∪ B`) is computed and tessellated
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` AND its enclosed volume SHALL equal `boxVol + π·r²·h_boss − π·r²·h_overlap` within the curved-face deflection bound

#### Scenario: A box-cylinder common is a watertight solid with exact analytic volume (host)
- GIVEN an axis-aligned box `A` and an axis-parallel cylinder `B`, both native, built on the host with no OCCT
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 2)` (common, `A ∩ B`) is computed and tessellated
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` AND its enclosed volume SHALL equal `π·r²·h_overlap` within the curved-face deflection bound

#### Scenario: The curved cap↔lateral circle seam welds watertight across the deflection ladder (host)
- GIVEN a native axis-aligned box-cylinder boolean result whose cap `Plane` disk shares a `Circle` seam with the `Cylinder` lateral patch
- WHEN it is tessellated at every deflection in the mesher's deflection ladder
- THEN the shared circle seam SHALL weld (both faces pinned to the ONE shared arc discretization) AND `boundaryEdgeCount == 0` at every deflection

### Requirement: SSI-curve-driven curved boolean for transversal elementary pairs

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, op)` — `op = 0` fuse
(`A ∪ B`), `op = 1` cut (`A − B`), `op = 2` common (`A ∩ B`) — NATIVELY for
**transversal elementary curved pairs** (a pair where at least one operand has a
Cylinder / Sphere / Cone face, outside the analytic axis-aligned box∩cylinder family,
whose S3 intersection trace is fully transversal) by consuming the native, OCCT-free S3
`cybercad::native::ssi` `TraceSet`. The builder SHALL be a SIBLING path to the planar
BSP-CSG and the analytic `curved.h`, invoked through the same `boolean_solid` entry
behind the `cc_boolean` op codes, and SHALL:

- **Gate.** For each pair of intersecting curved faces, build the two `SurfaceAdapter`s
  and obtain the S3 `TraceSet`; PROCEED only when the trace is fully transversal
  (`nearTangentGaps == 0` and every consumed `WLine.status` is `Closed` or
  `BoundaryExit`). Otherwise return a NULL `Shape` (→ OCCT fallback).
- **Split.** Cut each curved face along its `WLine` using the WLine's per-node `(u,v)`
  track on that face as the split polyline in the face's UV domain (the curved analogue
  of the planar `splitPolygon`), partitioning the trimmed face into fragments; the shared
  **seam edge** SHALL take its 3D geometry from the WLine's fitted B-spline and its
  pcurve on each face from that face's `(u,v)` track, and each fragment SHALL retain its
  parent face's exact surface kind (Cylinder / Sphere / Cone / Plane) — nothing faceted.
- **Classify.** Tag each fragment INSIDE / OUTSIDE / ON the OTHER solid via a curved
  point-in-solid test at an interior UV sample of the fragment (the planar
  side-of-boundary classification idea generalized to curved faces), and select the
  surviving fragments per the op's face-survival rule — the SAME set algebra as the
  planar path (fuse: `A` outside `B` + `B` outside `A`; cut: `A` outside `B` + `B` inside
  `A` reversed; common: `A` inside `B` + `B` inside `A`), oriented outward. A sample that
  is robustly ON the other solid (coincident / tangent) SHALL abort the native path
  (NULL → OCCT), never a guessed side.
- **Weld.** Sew the surviving curved + planar fragments into one closed `Solid`, welding
  coincident corners to shared vertices and sharing the WLine seam edge between exactly
  the two fragments it split (one from each operand), so the two faces meet watertight
  along the curved seam (the tessellator's curved-seam weld).

The result SHALL be a native `topology::Shape` of type `Solid` carrying true curved face
kinds, watertight (every edge shared by exactly two faces), whose enclosed volume equals
the exact set-algebra value for the op within a relative tolerance sized to the
curved-face tessellation deflection. The builder SHALL remain OCCT-free and reference no
OCCT / `IEngine` / `EngineShape` type, and — because it consumes the S3 tracer — its
SSI-driven entry point SHALL be compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`. No `cc_*` entry
point, signature, or POD struct SHALL be added or changed.

#### Scenario: Equal-radius crossing cylinders common is the Steinmetz solid (host)
- GIVEN two equal-radius cylinders of radius `r` crossing at right angles, built as
  native curved solids on the host with no OCCT, and their S3 `TraceSet` (fully
  transversal)
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 2)` (common) is computed and tessellated by
  `src/native/tessellate`
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` (`boundaryEdgeCount == 0`) with every
  edge shared by exactly two faces AND its enclosed volume SHALL equal the analytic
  Steinmetz value `16 · r³ / 3` within the curved-face deflection tolerance

#### Scenario: A curved cut / fuse is watertight with the correct set-algebra volume (host)
- GIVEN a transversal elementary curved pair (e.g. sphere∩box or cone∩box) built as
  native curved solids on the host with no OCCT, and its fully-transversal S3 `TraceSet`
- WHEN the corresponding `cc_boolean` op (cut or fuse) is computed and tessellated
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight closed 2-manifold `Solid` with every seam node on
  BOTH surfaces within tolerance AND its enclosed volume SHALL have the correct
  set-algebra sign and magnitude for the op within the curved-face deflection tolerance

#### Scenario: The split is driven by the WLine, not by per-primitive matching (host)
- GIVEN two distinct transversal elementary curved pairs (e.g. cyl∩cyl and sphere∩box)
  and their S3 `TraceSet`s
- WHEN each pair's curved faces are split along their `WLine` `(u,v)` tracks
- THEN the SAME split → classify → weld driver SHALL handle both pairs by consuming their
  WLines, with no hand-matched per-primitive result builder for either pair

#### Scenario: A verified native curved boolean is read back by the native paths (host)
- GIVEN a native SSI-driven curved boolean result that PASSES the engine self-verify
  (watertight 2-manifold with the correct set-algebra volume)
- WHEN its mass properties, bounding box, sub-shape ids, and tessellation are queried
- THEN they SHALL be served by the native body-consuming paths with no fallback call

### Requirement: SSI curved boolean self-verify guard (discard and fall through)

The engine SHALL accept a native SSI-driven curved boolean result as native ONLY when it
PASSES the mandatory self-verify: the candidate SHALL be (a) a **closed watertight
2-manifold** (closed at every deflection in the mesher's deflection ladder, positive
enclosed volume, every edge shared by exactly two faces) AND (b) have the **correct
set-algebra volume sign and magnitude** for the op — `Vr ≈ |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B|` (fuse),
`Vr ≈ |A| − |A ∩ B|` (cut), or `Vr ≈ |A ∩ B|` (common) — within a RELATIVE tolerance
sized to the curved-face tessellation deflection (curved faces are deflection-bounded,
not fp-exact), using the operands' native volumes and their native intersection volume
(the Steinmetz `16 r³ / 3` for the equal-cyl common serves as the host analytic oracle).
If EITHER check fails, the engine SHALL **DISCARD** the native result. The engine SHALL
NEVER emit an unverified, leaky, or wrong SSI-driven curved boolean; when either operand
is OCCT-built the discarded case SHALL fall through to OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI`, and when both
operands are native voids OCCT cannot read, the engine SHALL report an honest error.
The self-verify guard SHALL live in the engine (next to the OCCT fallback), not in the
OCCT-free builder library.

#### Scenario: A bad native SSI curved boolean result is discarded (host)
- GIVEN a native SSI-driven curved boolean candidate that is open / non-manifold OR whose
  enclosed volume is outside the deflection-sized band for its op, built on the host
- WHEN the self-verify guard is applied
- THEN the guard SHALL reject the candidate AND the engine SHALL NOT emit a leaky or wrong
  curved solid (a native-native case reports an honest error; a case with an OCCT operand
  falls through to OCCT)

#### Scenario: A verified equal-cyl common passes the Steinmetz analytic oracle (host)
- GIVEN a native equal-radius right-angle cylinder∩cylinder `common` candidate whose
  enclosed volume matches the analytic `16 · r³ / 3` within the deflection band, built on
  the host
- WHEN the self-verify guard is applied
- THEN the analytic-volume oracle SHALL accept the candidate AND it SHALL be served
  natively with no fallback call

### Requirement: Near-tangent, coincident, branch-point, and freeform curved pairs fall through to OCCT

The SSI-driven curved boolean builder SHALL DECLINE (return a NULL `Shape`) for any case
outside the transversal-elementary slice: (1) the S3 `TraceSet` for an intersecting face
pair reports **`nearTangentGaps > 0`**, or any consumed `WLine.status` is `NearTangent`
or `Failed` (the branch was traced only up to a tangent — the S4 seam); (2) a fragment's
interior sample lands **ON** the other solid within tolerance (a **coincident /
tangent-face** configuration — no robust inside/outside); (3) **coincident /
overlapping** curved faces (no discrete transversal seam to split); (4) a **branch-point
/ self-intersecting** seam (a singular multi-branch crossing); (5) a **freeform** (NURBS
/ Bézier) operand face (S5-a is elementary-only); (6) either operand is not a native
body. When either operand is an OCCT body, each such case SHALL produce EXACTLY the
fallback (OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI`) engine's result; when both operands are native voids OCCT
cannot read, the engine SHALL report an honest error. The change SHALL NOT fake,
stub-out, hand-tune, or partially implement any deferred case; each SHALL be labelled and
verified as a fall-through, never faked. `nearTangentGaps > 0` SHALL be treated as the
honest S4 fallback boundary, not consumed and not an error.

#### Scenario: A near-tangent curved pair declines to OCCT (host + parity)
- GIVEN a curved boolean whose S3 `TraceSet` reports `nearTangentGaps > 0` (e.g. tangent
  cylinders / a sphere tangent to a box face), with the native engine active
  (`cc_set_engine(1)`)
- WHEN `cc_boolean` is invoked
- THEN the SSI-driven builder SHALL return a NULL `Shape` AND (with an OCCT operand) the
  result SHALL be identical to invoking the same call with the OCCT engine active
  (`cc_set_engine(0)`), proving fall-through with no native interception

#### Scenario: A coincident / branch-point curved pair declines (host)
- GIVEN a curved configuration with coincident / overlapping faces or a branch-point /
  self-intersecting seam (no single transversal seam per face), with the native engine
  active
- WHEN `cc_boolean` is invoked
- THEN the SSI-driven builder SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (rather than emit a wrong
  classification) AND the engine SHALL NOT emit a native result for that call

#### Scenario: A freeform or non-native operand falls through (host)
- GIVEN a curved boolean where an operand has a NURBS / Bézier face, OR an operand is not
  a native body, with the native engine active
- WHEN `cc_boolean` is invoked
- THEN the SSI-driven builder SHALL return a NULL `Shape` AND fall through to the fallback
  engine for that call, identical to `cc_set_engine(0)`

### Requirement: SSI curved boolean parity with OCCT through the facade (simulator gate)

The SSI-driven curved boolean's fidelity SHALL be reported as a **measured native-vs-OCCT
parity** against `BRepAlgoAPI_{Fuse,Cut,Common}` on the simulator — **volume**,
**surface area**, **watertightness** (closed shell), and **shape validity** (`BRepCheck`)
— on transversal elementary pairs (cylinder∩cylinder including the Steinmetz common,
sphere∩box, cone∩box), rather than asserted to be a perfect result. The harness SHALL be
modelled on the S3 marching sim harness (`scripts/run-sim-native-ssi-marching.sh` +
`tests/sim/native_ssi_marching_parity.mm`), built against the SDK sysroot, linked with
the numsci IOSSIM substrate and the OCCT-for-iOS libs, and run via `xcrun simctl spawn`
on a booted simulator. The count of pairs deferred to OCCT (near-tangent / coincident /
freeform) SHALL be **reported** (the S4 seam), not hidden or padded, and whatever S5-a
cannot compute SHALL fall back to OCCT and be reported with the measured gap.

#### Scenario: native-vs-OCCT curved boolean parity is reported per pair on the simulator
- GIVEN a transversal elementary curved pair built both as native curved solids and as
  OCCT `BRepPrimAPI` solids
- WHEN the native SSI-driven boolean and OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_{Fuse,Cut,Common}` each compute
  the op on the simulator
- THEN the harness SHALL report the native vs OCCT volume delta, surface-area delta,
  watertight/closed-shell status, and shape validity within tolerance, compared at the
  `cybercad::native::boolean` C++ boundary
- AND no `cc_*` entry point SHALL have been added, and the count of pairs deferred to OCCT
  SHALL be reported, not hidden

#### Scenario: a deferred pair is reported as an OCCT fall-through, not faked
- GIVEN a curved pair S5-a cannot compute (near-tangent / coincident / freeform)
- WHEN parity is measured
- THEN the harness SHALL report it as deferred to OCCT (counted, with the measured gap)
  AND the native path SHALL have emitted no fabricated or hand-tuned result for it

### Requirement: SSI-driven native Fuse and Cut for the through-drill cylinder∩cylinder pair

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, op)` — `op = 0` fuse
(`A ∪ B`), `op = 1` cut (`A − B`) — NATIVELY for the **through-drill
cylinder∩cylinder** topology the S5-a COMMON path (`buildCommon`) already recognises: two
transversal, fully-traced (`nearTangentGaps == 0`) closed rim seams, one operand
full-circle on both (the piercing tube), the other local on both (the pierced mouths). It
SHALL reuse the SAME two rim seams, the SAME shared `VertexPool` weld, and the SAME
planar-triangle facet discipline as the S5-a COMMON, and SHALL select the surviving
fragments per the op's face-survival rule — the SAME set algebra as the planar path:

- **Cut `A − B`** (`A` = the pierced cylinder, `B` = the piercing tube): the pierced wall
  and end caps OUTSIDE the tube (re-trimmed to exclude the drilled region) + the tube band
  INSIDE the pierced solid REVERSED as the inward tunnel wall; the two drill-mouth caps
  (removed material) SHALL be dropped.
- **Fuse `A ∪ B`**: the pierced wall OUTSIDE the tube + the tube wall OUTSIDE the pierced
  solid (each outside stretch with its own end-cap disc) + the operands' end caps; the two
  drill-mouth caps AND the inside tube band (now interior to the union) SHALL be dropped.

Every face that shares a rim seam with a differently tessellated neighbour SHALL be
emitted as PLANAR-TRIANGLE facets through the EXACT traced seam nodes drawn from the shared
`VertexPool`, so the shell welds watertight (the S5-a watertight discipline). Fragment
survival SHALL be decided by the S5-a curved point-in-solid test (`classifyPoint`) at an
interior sample; a sample that is robustly ON the other solid, an unrecognised
through-drill topology, or a weld that cannot close SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (→ OCCT).

The result SHALL be a native `topology::Shape` of type `Solid` carrying true curved face
kinds, watertight (every edge shared by exactly two faces), whose enclosed volume equals
the exact set-algebra value for the op within a relative tolerance sized to the
curved-face tessellation deflection: `Vr ≈ vol(A) + vol(B) − vol(A ∩ B)` (fuse) or
`Vr ≈ vol(A) − vol(A ∩ B)` (cut), where `vol(A ∩ B)` is the S5-a through-drill COMMON. The
builder SHALL remain OCCT-free and reference no OCCT / `IEngine` / `EngineShape` type, and
SHALL be compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`. No `cc_*` entry point, signature, or POD
struct SHALL be added or changed, and the S5-a `buildCommon` COMMON path SHALL be
unchanged.

#### Scenario: The through-drill cut removes the tunnel with the correct volume (host)
- GIVEN a thin cylinder drilled clean through a fat one (the S5-a transversal through-drill
  fixture, `nearTangentGaps == 0`, two closed rim seams), built as native curved solids on
  the host with no OCCT
- WHEN `cc_boolean(fat, thin, 1)` (cut) is computed and tessellated by
  `src/native/tessellate`
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` (every edge shared by exactly two faces)
  AND its enclosed volume SHALL equal `vol(fat) − vol(fat ∩ thin)` within the curved-face
  deflection tolerance (`vol(fat ∩ thin)` = the S5-a-pinned through-drill COMMON volume)

#### Scenario: The through-drill fuse welds both cylinders with the correct volume (host)
- GIVEN the same transversal through-drill pair built as native curved solids on the host
  with no OCCT
- WHEN `cc_boolean(fat, thin, 0)` (fuse) is computed and tessellated
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight closed 2-manifold `Solid` AND its enclosed volume
  SHALL equal `vol(fat) + vol(thin) − vol(fat ∩ thin)` within the curved-face deflection
  tolerance AND SHALL satisfy `fuse ≥ max(vol(fat), vol(thin))`

#### Scenario: Fuse and cut reuse the S5-a seam and weld, not a new trace (host)
- GIVEN the through-drill pair and its shipped S3 `TraceSet` (the SAME two rim seams the
  S5-a COMMON consumes)
- WHEN the native fuse and cut are assembled
- THEN they SHALL be built from the SAME two rim seams and the SAME shared-vertex
  planar-facet weld as the S5-a COMMON, with no new tracing and no hand-matched
  per-primitive result builder

### Requirement: SSI-driven native Common for the transversal sphere∩sphere lens

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, 2)` (common, `A ∩ B`) NATIVELY
for a **transversal sphere∩sphere** pair via a NEW single-seam / two-cap assembler
(`buildLensCommon`), taken when the S3 `TraceSet` is ONE `Closed` seam
(`nearTangentGaps == 0`) and BOTH operands are recognised as `Sphere` curved solids. The
sphere∩sphere COMMON (lens) is bounded by TWO spherical caps — the cap of sphere A inside
sphere B and the cap of sphere B inside sphere A — meeting along the ONE seam circle. The
assembler SHALL:

- **Gate.** Require exactly one closed seam and both operands spheres; a seam that is a
  full sphere (a coincident / degenerate case) SHALL return NULL.
- **Cap survival (COMMON rule).** Take each cap's POLE (sphere A's surface point nearest
  sphere B's centre, and symmetrically), evaluated on the analytic sphere; keep the A-cap
  ONLY IF its pole is INSIDE sphere B and the B-cap ONLY IF its pole is INSIDE sphere A
  (the S5-a `classifyPoint` test). A pole robustly ON the other sphere (tangent /
  coincident) SHALL abort the native path → NULL → OCCT, never a guessed side.
- **Cap weld.** Emit each cap with the SAME radial-ring planar-facet discipline as the
  S5-a drill-mouth cap (fan from the pole out through concentric rings to the OUTER ring =
  the EXACT traced seam nodes drawn from the shared `VertexPool`, every ring node on the
  analytic sphere, facet normals oriented outward). Because BOTH caps' outer rings are the
  SAME pooled seam vertices, the two caps SHALL weld watertight along the single seam.

The result SHALL be a native `topology::Shape` of type `Solid`, watertight (every edge
shared by exactly two faces), with every seam node on BOTH spheres within tolerance, whose
enclosed volume equals the closed-form lens volume within the curved-face deflection
tolerance:
`V = π (rA + rB − d)² (d² + 2 d·rB − 3 rB² + 2 d·rA + 6 rA·rB − 3 rA²) / (12 d)`
for centre distance `d` (equal radii `r`: two caps of height `h = r − d/2`, cap volume
`π h² (3r − h) / 3`, lens `= 2 ×`). The assembler SHALL remain OCCT-free and be compiled
under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`; no `cc_*` entry point SHALL be added or changed, and the S5-a
two-seam `buildCommon` path SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: Equal-radius sphere∩sphere common matches the closed-form lens (host)
- GIVEN two equal-radius spheres (radius `r`, centre distance `0 < d < 2r`) built as native
  curved solids on the host with no OCCT, and their S3 `TraceSet` (one `Closed` seam,
  `nearTangentGaps == 0`)
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 2)` (common) is computed and tessellated
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` (every edge shared by exactly two faces)
  with every seam node on both spheres within tolerance AND its enclosed volume SHALL
  equal the lens `2 · π h² (3r − h) / 3`, `h = r − d/2`, within the curved-face deflection
  tolerance

#### Scenario: Unequal-radius sphere∩sphere common matches the closed-form lens (host)
- GIVEN two spheres of distinct radii `rA ≠ rB` with `|rA − rB| < d < rA + rB`, built as
  native curved solids on the host, and their one-seam S3 `TraceSet`
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 2)` (common) is computed and tessellated
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` whose enclosed volume equals the asymmetric
  lens closed form within the curved-face deflection tolerance

#### Scenario: A single-seam sphere pair is handled by the two-cap path, not the tube path (host)
- GIVEN a transversal sphere∩sphere pair (one closed seam) and a through-drill
  cylinder∩cylinder pair (two rim seams)
- WHEN each is dispatched
- THEN the sphere pair SHALL be assembled by the single-seam two-cap `buildLensCommon` and
  the cylinder pair by the two-seam `buildCommon`, each by its own topology gate, with no
  cross-contamination and no hand-matched per-primitive builder

### Requirement: The wider SSI curved booleans are guarded by the existing engine self-verify

The engine SHALL accept a native S5-b fuse / cut or S5-c sphere∩sphere common result as
native ONLY when it PASSES the EXISTING mandatory self-verify
(`native_engine.cpp booleanResultVerified`): a closed watertight 2-manifold with the
correct set-algebra volume — `Vr ≈ va + vb − vc` (fuse), `Vr ≈ va − vc` (cut), or
`Vr ≈ vc` (common) — within a relative tolerance sized to the curved-face tessellation
deflection, where `vc` is the native COMMON volume (the through-drill COMMON for the
cylinder pair; the lens for the sphere pair). NO new engine oracle SHALL be added: the
generic set-algebra guard already computes these, and the `ssiCurvedBooleanVerified`
Steinmetz special oracle (equal-radius perpendicular cylinders) SHALL remain untouched and
SHALL NOT fire for these cases. If the self-verify fails, the engine SHALL DISCARD the
native result and fall through to OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI` (OCCT operand) or report an honest
error (both operands native voids). The engine SHALL NEVER emit an unverified, leaky, or
wrong wider SSI curved boolean.

#### Scenario: A bad wider SSI curved boolean candidate is discarded (host)
- GIVEN a native S5-b fuse/cut or S5-c sphere-common candidate that is open / non-manifold
  OR whose enclosed volume is outside the deflection-sized band for its op, built on the
  host
- WHEN the existing generic set-algebra self-verify guard is applied
- THEN the guard SHALL reject the candidate AND the engine SHALL NOT emit a leaky or wrong
  curved solid (a native-native case reports an honest error; an OCCT-operand case falls
  through to OCCT)

#### Scenario: A verified fuse / cut / lens-common passes the existing guard (host)
- GIVEN a native through-drill fuse or cut whose watertight volume matches
  `va + vb − vc` / `va − vc`, OR a native sphere∩sphere common whose volume matches the
  closed-form lens, all within the deflection band
- WHEN the existing generic set-algebra guard is applied
- THEN the guard SHALL accept the candidate AND it SHALL be served natively with no OCCT
  fallback call AND the Steinmetz special oracle SHALL NOT have fired

### Requirement: Out-of-envelope wider curved pairs fall through to OCCT

The wider SSI curved boolean builders SHALL DECLINE (return a NULL `Shape`) for any case
outside the two shipped slices: (1) **sphere∩sphere fuse / cut** (S5-c ships COMMON only);
(2) **tangent / coincident spheres** (`nearTangentGaps > 0`, or a cap pole robustly ON the
other sphere); (3) **equal-radius orthogonal cylinder∩cylinder** (the Steinmetz pair —
`nearTangentGaps > 0`, an S4 case); (4) **oblique / multi-tube cylinder∩cylinder**
piercings whose seams are not two clean full-circle rims; (5) **other curved-curved
families** (cylinder∩cone, cylinder∩sphere, cone∩cone, sphere∩box, freeform). When either
operand is an OCCT body, each such case SHALL produce EXACTLY the OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI`
fallback result; when both operands are native voids OCCT cannot read, the engine SHALL
report an honest error. The change SHALL NOT fake, stub-out, hand-tune, or partially
implement any deferred case; `nearTangentGaps > 0` SHALL remain the honest S4 fallback
boundary, not consumed and not an error.

#### Scenario: A sphere∩sphere fuse or cut declines to OCCT (host)
- GIVEN a transversal sphere∩sphere pair with the native engine active
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 0)` (fuse) or `cc_boolean(A, B, 1)` (cut) is invoked
- THEN the wider builder SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (S5-c ships COMMON only) AND (with an
  OCCT operand) the result SHALL be identical to invoking the same call with the OCCT
  engine active, proving fall-through with no native interception

#### Scenario: Tangent spheres and the Steinmetz cylinder pair decline (host)
- GIVEN two tangent spheres (`d = rA + rB`) OR two equal-radius perpendicular cylinders
  (the Steinmetz pair), with the native engine active
- WHEN `cc_boolean` (common) is invoked
- THEN the wider builder SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (near-tangent → S4) AND the engine
  SHALL NOT emit a native result for that call

### Requirement: Wider SSI curved boolean parity with OCCT through the facade (simulator gate)

The wider SSI curved booleans' fidelity SHALL be reported as a MEASURED native-vs-OCCT
parity against `BRepAlgoAPI_{Fuse,Cut,Common}` on the simulator — volume, surface area,
watertightness (closed shell), and shape validity (`BRepCheck`) — on the through-drill
cylinder∩cylinder **fuse** and **cut** and the transversal sphere∩sphere **common** (built
as OCCT `BRepPrimAPI_MakeSphere` / cylinder solids), extending the S5-a harness
(`scripts/run-sim-native-ssi-curved-boolean.sh` +
`tests/sim/native_ssi_curved_boolean_parity.mm`) rather than adding a new harness. The
count of pairs still deferred to OCCT (sphere fuse/cut, near-tangent, out-of-family) SHALL
be REPORTED (the S4 / follow-on seam), not hidden or padded, and whatever the wider slices
cannot compute SHALL fall back to OCCT and be reported with the measured gap.

#### Scenario: native-vs-OCCT parity is reported per wider pair on the simulator
- GIVEN the through-drill fuse/cut pair and the transversal sphere∩sphere common pair,
  each built both as native curved solids and as OCCT `BRepPrimAPI` solids
- WHEN the native wider boolean and OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_{Fuse,Cut,Common}` each compute the
  op on the simulator
- THEN the harness SHALL report the native-vs-OCCT volume delta, surface-area delta,
  watertight/closed-shell status, and shape validity within tolerance, compared at the
  `cybercad::native::boolean` C++ boundary
- AND no `cc_*` entry point SHALL have been added, and the count of pairs deferred to OCCT
  SHALL be reported, not hidden

### Requirement: SSI-driven native Common for the Steinmetz-family branched pair

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, 2)` (common, `A ∩ B`) NATIVELY for
the **Steinmetz family** — two `Cylinder` curved solids of equal radius (`|rA − rB|` within
tolerance) whose axes are orthogonal (`|â · b̂|` within tolerance) and cross (the axis lines
meet within tolerance) — via a NEW branched-trace assembler (`buildSteinmetzCommon`). The
assembler SHALL consume the S4-d branched `ssi::TraceSet` obtained with
`MarchOptions.enableBranchPoints = true`, and SHALL recognise the Steinmetz structure ONLY
when the trace is fully resolved: `nearTangentGaps == 0`, `branchPoints == 2` with
`branchNodes.size() == 2`, EXACTLY FOUR WLines all of `status == BranchArc`, every arm on both
cylinders within `onSurfTol`, and the two branch nodes connecting all four arms (each arm's two
endpoints coincide with the two branch-node points). The assembler SHALL:

- **Split.** On each cylinder the two arms lying on that cylinder bound the region of its wall
  INSIDE the other cylinder; SPLIT the wall along its two arcs into the candidate lune patches,
  each emitted as a strip of PLANAR triangles between its two arcs (walked branch-to-branch in
  lockstep), every interior sample placed ON the analytic cylinder and its `(u,v)` folded
  contiguous around the patch centroid so no ±2π wrap corrupts it.
- **Select (COMMON rule).** KEEP each lune patch ONLY IF its centroid sample is INSIDE the
  OTHER cylinder (`classifyPoint(other, centroid) == inside`) — the four inside∩inside patches
  ARE the bicylinder boundary. A centroid robustly ON the other cylinder SHALL abort the native
  path → NULL → OCCT, never a guessed side.
- **Weld.** Emit every seam-adjacent patch as PLANAR-TRIANGLE facets through the EXACT traced
  arc nodes drawn from ONE shared `VertexPool`, with the two branch-point vertices pooled ONCE
  so all four arcs meet there with no crack; both sides of every shared arc draw the SAME
  pooled vertices, so the four lune patches weld watertight along the four arcs and the two
  branch points (the S5-a planar-facet weld discipline). Facet normals SHALL be oriented
  outward (the cylinder's outward radial).

The result SHALL be a native `topology::Shape` of type `Solid`, watertight (every edge shared
by exactly two faces), with every arc node on BOTH cylinders within tolerance and the two
branch-point vertices a single shared node, whose enclosed volume equals the EXACT Steinmetz
bicylinder value `16 R³ / 3` within the curved-face tessellation deflection tolerance. The
assembler SHALL remain OCCT-free and reference no OCCT / `IEngine` / `EngineShape` type, and
SHALL be compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`. No `cc_*` entry point, signature, or POD struct
SHALL be added or changed, and the single-seam S5-a/b/c paths SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: The Steinmetz common matches the exact analytic bicylinder volume (host)

- GIVEN two equal-radius cylinders (radius `R`) whose axes cross orthogonally at the origin,
  built as native curved solids on the host with no OCCT, and their S4-d branched `TraceSet`
  (obtained with `enableBranchPoints = true`: `branchPoints == 2`, four `BranchArc` arms,
  `nearTangentGaps == 0`)
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 2)` (common) is computed and tessellated by `src/native/tessellate`
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` (every edge shared by exactly two faces) with
  every arc node on both cylinders within tolerance and the two branch-point vertices a single
  shared node AND its enclosed volume SHALL equal the exact bicylinder `16 R³ / 3` within the
  curved-face deflection tolerance

#### Scenario: The four lune patches weld at the shared arcs and the two branch points (host)

- GIVEN the Steinmetz pair and its S4-d branched `TraceSet` (four `BranchArc` arms meeting at
  two branch nodes)
- WHEN `buildSteinmetzCommon` splits each cylinder wall along its arcs, selects the four
  inside-the-other lune patches, and welds them
- THEN the four lune patches SHALL be assembled from the SAME traced arc nodes drawn from ONE
  shared `VertexPool` with the two branch-point vertices pooled ONCE, so all four arcs weld at
  the two branch points and both sides of every arc weld along the arc, with no new tracing and
  no hand-matched per-primitive result builder

### Requirement: SSI-driven native Fuse and Cut for the Steinmetz-family branched pair

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, op)` — `op = 0` fuse (`A ∪ B`),
`op = 1` cut (`A − B`) — NATIVELY for the Steinmetz family (the SAME recognised branched trace
the COMMON path consumes) WHEN it can assemble a watertight, correct-volume shell, reusing the
SAME four arcs, the SAME shared `VertexPool` weld (arcs + the two branch-point vertices), and
the SAME planar-triangle facet discipline as the COMMON, and selecting the surviving fragments
per the op's face-survival rule — the SAME set algebra as the planar path:

- **Cut `A − B`**: A's wall OUTSIDE B + A's two end caps + B's inside-A lune patches REVERSED
  (the tunnel wall); A's inside-B lune patches SHALL be dropped. The shared arcs weld the
  reversed B patches to A's outside wall.
- **Fuse `A ∪ B`**: each cylinder's OUTSIDE-the-other wall + both cylinders' end caps; both
  cylinders' inside-the-other lune patches SHALL be dropped (now interior to the union). The
  shared arcs weld the two outer walls.

Fragment survival SHALL be decided by the S5-a curved point-in-solid test (`classifyPoint`) at
an interior sample; a sample robustly ON the other solid, a non-Steinmetz branched trace, or a
weld that cannot close SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (→ OCCT). The result SHALL be a native
`topology::Shape` of type `Solid`, watertight (every edge shared by exactly two faces), whose
enclosed volume equals the exact set-algebra value for the op within a relative tolerance sized
to the curved-face tessellation deflection: `Vr ≈ vol(A) + vol(B) − vol(A ∩ B)` (fuse) or
`Vr ≈ vol(A) − vol(A ∩ B)` (cut), where `vol(A ∩ B)` is the native Steinmetz COMMON. A builder
that cannot robustly assemble a watertight, correct-volume shell SHALL return NULL (→ OCCT),
reported — the COMMON is the guaranteed slice. The builder SHALL remain OCCT-free and be
compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`; no `cc_*` entry point SHALL be added or changed, and the
single-seam S5-a/b/c paths SHALL be unchanged.

#### Scenario: The Steinmetz cut removes the bicylinder with the correct volume (host)

- GIVEN the equal-R orthogonal Steinmetz pair built as native curved solids on the host with no
  OCCT, and its S4-d branched `TraceSet`
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 1)` (cut) is computed and tessellated and the builder assembles a
  watertight shell
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight `Solid` (every edge shared by exactly two faces) AND its
  enclosed volume SHALL equal `vol(A) − 16 R³ / 3` within the curved-face deflection tolerance;
  a builder that cannot assemble a watertight, correct-volume shell SHALL return NULL (→ OCCT)

#### Scenario: The Steinmetz fuse welds both cylinders with the correct volume (host)

- GIVEN the same equal-R orthogonal Steinmetz pair built as native curved solids on the host
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, 0)` (fuse) is computed and tessellated and the builder assembles a
  watertight shell
- THEN the result SHALL be a watertight closed 2-manifold `Solid` AND its enclosed volume SHALL
  equal `vol(A) + vol(B) − 16 R³ / 3` within the curved-face deflection tolerance AND SHALL
  satisfy `fuse ≥ max(vol(A), vol(B))`; a builder that cannot assemble a watertight,
  correct-volume shell SHALL return NULL (→ OCCT)

### Requirement: The Steinmetz branched curved boolean is guarded by the existing engine self-verify

The engine SHALL accept a native S5-d Steinmetz COMMON / FUSE / CUT result as native ONLY when
it PASSES the EXISTING mandatory self-verify: a closed watertight 2-manifold with the correct
volume. The Steinmetz COMMON SHALL be verified by the engine's EXISTING
`ssiCurvedBooleanVerified` Steinmetz oracle (op == common, equal-radius orthogonal cylinders —
the `16 R³ / 3` closed form), which previously always found a NULL native candidate and fell to
OCCT and now verifies the branched native candidate's watertight volume against `16 R³ / 3`.
The Steinmetz FUSE / CUT SHALL be verified by the EXISTING generic set-algebra guard
(`Vr ≈ va + vb − vc` / `va − vc`, `vc` = the native Steinmetz COMMON volume). NO new engine
oracle SHALL be added, and the single-seam S5-a/b/c guards SHALL remain untouched and SHALL NOT
fire for the branched Steinmetz case. If the self-verify fails, the engine SHALL DISCARD the
native result and fall through to OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI` (OCCT operand) or report an honest error
(both operands native voids). The engine SHALL NEVER emit an unverified, leaky, or wrong
Steinmetz curved boolean.

#### Scenario: A bad Steinmetz branched candidate is discarded (host)

- GIVEN a native S5-d Steinmetz COMMON / FUSE / CUT candidate that is open / non-manifold OR
  whose enclosed volume is outside the deflection-sized band for its op, built on the host
- WHEN the existing engine self-verify (the Steinmetz `16 R³/3` oracle for common; the generic
  set-algebra guard for fuse/cut) is applied
- THEN the guard SHALL reject the candidate AND the engine SHALL NOT emit a leaky or wrong
  curved solid (a native-native case reports an honest error; an OCCT-operand case falls through
  to OCCT)

#### Scenario: A verified Steinmetz common passes the existing oracle natively (host)

- GIVEN a native Steinmetz COMMON whose watertight volume matches the exact `16 R³ / 3` within
  the deflection band
- WHEN the existing `ssiCurvedBooleanVerified` Steinmetz oracle is applied
- THEN the oracle SHALL accept the candidate AND it SHALL be served natively with no OCCT
  fallback call AND no new engine oracle SHALL have been added

### Requirement: Out-of-family branched curved pairs fall through to OCCT

The S5-d branched assembler SHALL DECLINE (return a NULL `Shape`) for any branched curved pair
outside the recognised Steinmetz family: (1) **unequal-radius, non-orthogonal, or non-crossing
cylinder pairs** (the Steinmetz pre-gate rejects); (2) **cylinder∩sphere, cylinder∩cone,
cone∩cone, or freeform self-crossings**; (3) branched traces with `nearTangentGaps > 0` (an arm
the S4-d marcher could not resolve), `branchPoints != 2`, or a WLine count / status that is not
exactly four `BranchArc` arms. The branched re-trace SHALL be entered ONLY when the DEFAULT
(unbranched) trace declined AND the Steinmetz pre-gate matches, so no single-seam S5-a/b/c pass
re-traces or changes its result. When either operand is an OCCT body, each declined case SHALL
produce EXACTLY the OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI` fallback result; when both operands are native voids OCCT
cannot read, the engine SHALL report an honest error. The change SHALL NOT fake, stub-out,
hand-tune, or partially implement any deferred case; a branched trace that is not the exact
resolved Steinmetz structure SHALL remain the honest fallback boundary, not an error.

#### Scenario: An unequal-radius or non-orthogonal branched cylinder pair declines to OCCT (host)

- GIVEN two cylinders whose axes cross but with UNEQUAL radii, OR two equal-radius cylinders
  whose axes are NOT orthogonal, with the native engine active
- WHEN `cc_boolean(A, B, op)` is invoked for any op
- THEN the S5-d branched assembler SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (the Steinmetz pre-gate / the
  recognition gate rejects) AND (with an OCCT operand) the result SHALL be identical to invoking
  the same call with the OCCT engine active, proving fall-through with no native interception

#### Scenario: A single-seam S5-a/b/c pair never enters the branched re-trace (host)

- GIVEN a through-drill cylinder∩cylinder pair (unequal radii, two rim seams) and a transversal
  sphere∩sphere pair (one closed seam), each with the native engine active
- WHEN each is dispatched
- THEN each SHALL be handled by its single-seam S5-a/b/c builder on the DEFAULT trace with no
  branched re-trace, and the S5-d branched path SHALL NOT fire (its pre-gate requires equal-R
  orthogonal cylinders), with no cross-contamination and no hand-matched per-primitive builder

### Requirement: SSI-driven native Fuse for the transversal sphere∩sphere lens

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, op=0)` fuse (`A ∪ B`) NATIVELY
for the transversal sphere∩sphere pair the S5-c COMMON path (`buildLensCommon`) already
recognises: both operands recognised as `Sphere` solids, and the S3 trace a SINGLE closed
seam circle with `nearTangentGaps == 0`. It SHALL reuse the SAME decimated shared seam
(`decimateSeam(seam, seamNodeTarget(seam))`), the SAME shared `VertexPool` weld, and the
SAME radial-ring planar-triangle cap discipline as `buildLensCommon`, and SHALL assemble
the union boundary as the two **OUTER** spherical caps — the cap of A whose apex is A's far
pole (`cA − RA·unit(cA→cB)`) and the cap of B whose apex is B's far pole
(`cB + RB·unit(cA→cB)`) — each oriented with the sphere OUTWARD radial normal, welded along
the ONE shared seam.

The builder SHALL keep each outer cap only if its far-pole apex classifies strictly OUTSIDE
the other solid (the transversal-lens fuse survival rule, via the S5-a curved
point-in-solid test `classifyPoint`); a far pole robustly INSIDE the other sphere
(containment) or ON it (tangent), a non-sphere or multi-seam input, or a weld that cannot
close SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (→ OCCT). The tolerance SHALL NOT be weakened to force a
pass.

The result SHALL be a native `topology::Shape` of type `Solid` carrying true `Sphere` face
kinds, watertight (every edge shared by exactly two faces), whose enclosed volume equals
`vol(A) + vol(B) − vol(A ∩ B)` within a relative tolerance sized to the curved-face
tessellation deflection, where `vol(A ∩ B)` is the native lens COMMON (`buildLensCommon`).
The builder SHALL remain OCCT-free and reference no OCCT / `IEngine` / `EngineShape` type,
SHALL be compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, and SHALL add or change no `cc_*` entry
point, signature, or POD struct.

#### Scenario: The sphere∩sphere fuse grows to the peanut with the correct volume (host)
- GIVEN two overlapping spheres A (radius `RA`) and B (radius `RB`) whose centres are a
  distance `d` apart with `|RA − RB| < d < RA + RB` (a transversal lens), traced as ONE
  closed seam circle with `nearTangentGaps == 0`
- WHEN `ssi_boolean_solid(A, B, Op::Fuse)` runs (the through-drill `buildFuse` declines the
  single seam, `buildLensFuse` takes over)
- THEN it returns a watertight `Solid` (`boundaryEdgeCount == 0`, every edge shared by
  exactly two faces) bounded by the two OUTER spherical caps sharing the ONE seam
- AND its enclosed volume equals `4/3·π(RA³ + RB³) − lens` (with `lens = V_cap(A) +
  V_cap(B)`, `V_cap = π h² (3R − h)/3`) within the deflection-sized band — a GROW
  (`Vr > max(vol(A), vol(B))`)
- AND every seam node lies on BOTH sphere surfaces within tolerance.

#### Scenario: A far pole inside the other sphere declines to OCCT (host)
- GIVEN two spheres where one is largely contained in the other (a far pole classifies
  INSIDE the other solid), or tangent (a far pole ON the other surface)
- WHEN `ssi_boolean_solid(A, B, Op::Fuse)` runs
- THEN `buildLensFuse` returns a NULL `Shape` (the fuse survival rule needs both far poles
  strictly outside) and the engine falls through to OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_Fuse` — reported, not
  faked, tolerance not weakened.

#### Scenario: The engine discards a wrong-volume fuse candidate (host)
- GIVEN a fuse candidate whose welded shell volume does not match `vol(A) + vol(B) −
  vol(A ∩ B)` (a mis-welded seam or wrong cap selection)
- WHEN the engine's generic set-algebra self-verify runs (`expected = va + vb − vc`, `vc` =
  native lens COMMON)
- THEN the candidate FAILS the watertight + correct-volume guard and is DISCARDED → OCCT;
  the engine never emits an unverified sphere fuse.

### Requirement: SSI-driven native Cut for the transversal sphere∩sphere lens

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, op=1)` cut (`A − B`, `A` the
minuend) NATIVELY for the transversal sphere∩sphere pair the S5-c COMMON path already
recognises (both `Sphere`, one closed seam, `nearTangentGaps == 0`). It SHALL reuse the
SAME decimated shared seam, `VertexPool`, and radial-ring planar-triangle cap discipline as
`buildLensCommon`, and SHALL assemble the difference boundary as the **OUTER** cap of A
(apex = A's far pole, outward radial normal) plus the **INNER** cap of B (apex nearest A)
emitted **REVERSED** (inward radial normal) so it bounds the scooped cavity, both welded
along the ONE shared seam. Operand order SHALL be honoured (CUT is not symmetric),
matching `BRepAlgoAPI_Cut(a, b)`.

The builder SHALL proceed only if A's far-pole apex classifies OUTSIDE B AND B's inner apex
classifies INSIDE A (the transversal-lens cut survival rule, via `classifyPoint`); a
tangent / degenerate / wrong-side apex, a non-sphere or multi-seam input, or a weld that
cannot close SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (→ OCCT). The tolerance SHALL NOT be weakened.

The result SHALL be a native `topology::Shape` `Solid` with true `Sphere` face kinds,
watertight (every edge shared by exactly two faces), whose enclosed volume equals
`vol(A) − vol(A ∩ B)` within the deflection-sized relative tolerance, where `vol(A ∩ B)` is
the native lens COMMON. The builder SHALL remain OCCT-free, reference no OCCT / `IEngine` /
`EngineShape` type, be compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, and add or change no `cc_*`
entry point, signature, or POD struct.

#### Scenario: The sphere∩sphere cut scoops the lens with the correct volume (host)
- GIVEN two overlapping spheres A (radius `RA`, minuend) and B (radius `RB`), transversal
  lens, ONE closed seam, `nearTangentGaps == 0`
- WHEN `ssi_boolean_solid(A, B, Op::Cut)` runs (the through-drill `buildCut` declines the
  single seam, `buildLensCut` takes over)
- THEN it returns a watertight `Solid` bounded by A's OUTER cap (outward) plus B's INNER cap
  REVERSED (inward, bounding the cavity), sharing the ONE seam
- AND its enclosed volume equals `4/3·π·RA³ − lens` within the deflection-sized band — a
  SHRINK (`Vr < vol(A)`)
- AND every seam node lies on both sphere surfaces within tolerance.

#### Scenario: The reversed inner cap bounds the cavity, verified against the native lens (host)
- GIVEN the sphere∩sphere cut candidate above
- WHEN the engine's generic set-algebra self-verify runs (`expected = va − vc`, `vc` =
  native lens COMMON `buildLensCommon`)
- THEN a candidate whose reversed INNER-B cap is mis-oriented (outward, not bounding the
  cavity) yields the wrong enclosed volume, FAILS the guard, and is DISCARDED → OCCT — the
  correct candidate matches `vol(A) − lens` and is accepted native.

#### Scenario: The COMMON path is unchanged by the fuse/cut completion (host)
- GIVEN the SAME overlapping sphere pair
- WHEN `ssi_boolean_solid(A, B, Op::Common)` runs after the generalisation of
  `appendSphereCap` (defaulted `outer=false, reversed=false`)
- THEN `buildLensCommon` produces the byte-identical two-inner-cap lens (same volume, area,
  and vertices as before this change) — the COMMON native pass does not regress.

### Requirement: SSI-driven native Fuse for the Steinmetz bicylinder pair

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, op=0)` fuse (`A ∪ B`) NATIVELY for
the Steinmetz bicylinder pair the S5-d COMMON path (`buildSteinmetzCommon`) already recognises:
both operands recognised as `Cylinder` solids of near-equal radius whose axes cross orthogonally
(`steinmetzPreGate`), and the branch-enabled S4-d re-trace a resolved branched `TraceSet` with
`branchPoints == 2`, exactly four `BranchArc` arms on both cylinders, and `nearTangentGaps == 0`
(`recogniseSteinmetzTrace`). It SHALL reuse the SAME oriented + pole-axis-resampled four arcs
(`orientArc`, `resampleArcByAxis`), the SAME shared `VertexPool` weld with the two poles pooled
ONCE, and the SAME radial-ring planar-triangle lune discipline (`appendLunePatch`) as
`buildSteinmetzCommon`, and SHALL assemble the union boundary as the two OUTSIDE lune patches of
EACH cylinder (the wall regions outside the other cylinder, oriented with the cylinder OUTWARD
radial normal) PLUS both cylinders' two original disc end caps (full circles at `v = vLo` and
`v = vHi`, oriented along the outward axial direction), all sharing the four arcs and two poles.

The builder SHALL keep each outside lune only if its centroid classifies strictly OUTSIDE the
other solid (the fuse survival rule, via the S5-a curved point-in-solid test `classifyPoint`); a
centroid robustly ON the other wall (tangent), a short cylinder whose end-cap plane falls within
the intersection seam band, a non-Steinmetz or unresolved branched input, or a weld that cannot
close SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (→ OCCT). The tolerance SHALL NOT be weakened to force a pass.

The result SHALL be a native `topology::Shape` of type `Solid` carrying true `Cylinder` (wall)
and planar (cap) face kinds, watertight (every edge shared by exactly two faces), whose enclosed
volume equals `vol(A) + vol(B) − vol(A ∩ B)` within a relative tolerance sized to the curved-face
tessellation deflection, where `vol(A ∩ B)` is the native bicylinder COMMON (`buildSteinmetzCommon`
= `16 R³/3`). The builder SHALL remain OCCT-free and reference no OCCT / `IEngine` / `EngineShape`
type, SHALL be compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, and SHALL add or change no `cc_*` entry
point, signature, or POD struct.

#### Scenario: The Steinmetz fuse grows to the outer envelope with the correct volume (host)
- GIVEN two equal-radius cylinders A (radius `R`, length `L_A`) and B (radius `R`, length `L_B`)
  whose axes cross orthogonally, whose branch-enabled S4-d `TraceSet` has `branchPoints == 2`,
  four `BranchArc` arms, and `nearTangentGaps == 0`, and whose end caps lie outside the `|y| ≤ R`
  intersection band
- WHEN `ssi_boolean_solid(A, B, Op::Fuse)` runs (the default trace declines near-tangent, the
  branch-enabled re-trace resolves the four arcs, and `buildSteinmetzFuse` assembles the outer
  shell)
- THEN it returns a watertight `Solid` (`boundaryEdgeCount == 0`, every edge shared by exactly
  two faces) bounded by both cylinders' two OUTSIDE lune walls sharing the four arcs, closed by
  all four original disc end caps
- AND its enclosed volume equals `π R²(L_A + L_B) − 16 R³/3` within the deflection-sized band —
  a GROW (`Vr > max(vol(A), vol(B))`)
- AND every arc node lies on BOTH cylinder surfaces within tolerance, and the two branch-point
  poles are pooled ONCE (shared by all surviving lune fragments).

#### Scenario: A short cylinder whose caps clip the seam declines to OCCT (host)
- GIVEN a Steinmetz pair one of whose cylinders is so short that an end-cap plane falls within
  the `|y| ≤ R` intersection seam band (the disjoint-cap assumption fails)
- WHEN `ssi_boolean_solid(A, B, Op::Fuse)` runs
- THEN `appendCylinderEndCaps` reports the clip and `buildSteinmetzFuse` returns a NULL `Shape`,
  and the engine falls through to OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_Fuse` — reported, not faked, tolerance not
  weakened.

#### Scenario: The engine discards a wrong-volume Steinmetz fuse candidate (host)
- GIVEN a fuse candidate whose welded shell volume does not match
  `vol(A) + vol(B) − vol(A ∩ B)` (a mis-selected lune or a mis-placed cap)
- WHEN the engine's generic set-algebra self-verify runs (`expected = va + vb − vc`, `vc` =
  native bicylinder COMMON `buildSteinmetzCommon = 16 R³/3`; the `op == 2`-only analytic
  Steinmetz oracle does NOT intercept fuse)
- THEN the candidate FAILS the watertight + correct-volume guard and is DISCARDED → OCCT; the
  engine never emits an unverified Steinmetz fuse.

### Requirement: SSI-driven native Cut for the Steinmetz bicylinder pair

The native boolean library SHALL compute `cc_boolean(a, b, op=1)` cut (`A − B`, `A` the minuend)
NATIVELY for the Steinmetz bicylinder pair the S5-d COMMON path already recognises (both near-
equal-radius `Cylinder`, orthogonal crossing axes, a resolved 2-branch-point / four-`BranchArc`
`TraceSet` with `nearTangentGaps == 0`). It SHALL reuse the SAME oriented + pole-axis-resampled
four arcs, `VertexPool` (poles pooled once), and radial-ring planar-triangle lune discipline as
`buildSteinmetzCommon`, and SHALL assemble the difference boundary as A's two OUTSIDE lune walls
(outward radial normal) plus A's two original disc end caps, plus B's two INSIDE lune patches
emitted REVERSED (inward radial normal, `outwardSign = −1`) so they bound the carved channel
through A, all sharing the four arcs and two poles. Operand order SHALL be honoured (CUT is not
symmetric), matching `BRepAlgoAPI_Cut(a, b)`.

The builder SHALL proceed only if A's outside-lune centroids classify OUTSIDE B AND B's inside-
lune centroids classify INSIDE A (the cut survival rule, via `classifyPoint`); a tangent /
degenerate / wrong-side centroid, a short cylinder whose cap clips the seam band, a non-Steinmetz
or unresolved branched input, or a weld that cannot close SHALL return a NULL `Shape` (→ OCCT).
The tolerance SHALL NOT be weakened.

The result SHALL be a native `topology::Shape` `Solid` with true `Cylinder` (wall) and planar
(cap) face kinds, watertight (every edge shared by exactly two faces), whose enclosed volume
equals `vol(A) − vol(A ∩ B)` within the deflection-sized relative tolerance, where `vol(A ∩ B)`
is the native bicylinder COMMON. The builder SHALL remain OCCT-free, reference no OCCT /
`IEngine` / `EngineShape` type, be compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, and add or change no
`cc_*` entry point, signature, or POD struct.

#### Scenario: The Steinmetz cut carves the channel with the correct volume (host)
- GIVEN two equal-radius cylinders A (radius `R`, length `L_A`, minuend) and B (radius `R`),
  orthogonal crossing axes, a resolved 2-branch-point / four-arc `TraceSet` with
  `nearTangentGaps == 0`
- WHEN `ssi_boolean_solid(A, B, Op::Cut)` runs (branch-enabled re-trace resolves the arcs and
  `buildSteinmetzCut` assembles the shell)
- THEN it returns a watertight `Solid` bounded by A's two OUTSIDE lune walls (outward) + A's two
  disc caps + B's two INSIDE lune walls REVERSED (inward, bounding the channel), all sharing the
  four arcs
- AND its enclosed volume equals `π R² L_A − 16 R³/3` within the deflection-sized band — a SHRINK
  (`Vr < vol(A)`)
- AND every arc node lies on both cylinder surfaces within tolerance, and the two poles are
  pooled ONCE.

#### Scenario: The reversed inner lunes bound the channel, verified against the native common (host)
- GIVEN the Steinmetz cut candidate above
- WHEN the engine's generic set-algebra self-verify runs (`expected = va − vc`, `vc` = native
  bicylinder COMMON `buildSteinmetzCommon`; the `op == 2`-only analytic oracle does NOT intercept
  cut)
- THEN a candidate whose reversed INSIDE-B lunes are mis-oriented (outward, not bounding the
  channel) yields the wrong enclosed volume, FAILS the guard, and is DISCARDED → OCCT — the
  correct candidate matches `vol(A) − 16 R³/3` and is accepted native.

#### Scenario: The COMMON path is unchanged by the fuse/cut completion (host)
- GIVEN the SAME equal-radius orthogonal Steinmetz pair
- WHEN `ssi_boolean_solid(A, B, Op::Common)` runs after the shared arc/pole prologue is factored
  into `orientResampleArcs`
- THEN `buildSteinmetzCommon` produces the byte-identical four-inside-lune bicylinder (same
  volume `16 R³/3`, area, and vertices as before this change) — the COMMON native pass does not
  regress.
