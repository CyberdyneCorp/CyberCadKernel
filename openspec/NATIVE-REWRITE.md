# Phase 4 â Native Rewrite Sub-Roadmap (drop OCCT)

The endgame: replace the OCCT adapter with **native C++20**, one capability at a
time, until OCCT can be unlinked entirely. This sub-roadmap sequences that work
and fixes the rules every capability migration follows.

Committed goal: **full drop-OCCT**, including native booleans. Honest caveat:
robust B-rep booleans and shape healing are research-grade â they will land
*progressively hardened and verified against OCCT*, not production-robust on day
one. Difficulty is flagged per capability below.

**Where this stands now (honest ceiling).** The tractable native slice of every
capability #1â#7 is DONE at the verification bar â including the native STEP EXPORT
slice AND the first native STEP IMPORT slice (#7). Phase 4 is therefore **COMPLETE AT ITS ACHIEVABLE NATIVE CEILING, not
fully drop-OCCT**: #8 `drop-occt` is BLOCKED because two hard dependencies remain
research-grade multi-year efforts â (1) a general robust curved boolean / blend
kernel (arbitrary surface-surface intersection + shape healing) and (2) native
a FULL native STEP IMPORT (the native reader covers only the elementary/B-spline
AP203 subset the writer produces plus foreign OCCT-written box/cylinder; assemblies,
AP242, and complex profiles still fall back to OCCT). **IGES import/export are DESCOPED
(STEP-only interchange): no native IGES will be built; the `cc_iges_*` ABI stays
OCCT-backed until `drop-occt`, then removed/stubbed, never reimplemented.** Until both
the curved kernel and general STEP import exist, OCCT stays linked.

## Method (locked)

- **Clean-room from references.** Implement from math/first-principles, public
  algorithm references (e.g. *The NURBS Book* â de Boor, de Casteljau, basis
  functions; standard computational-geometry literature), and the `cc_*`
  contract. **OCCT source is a reference *oracle*** â consulted to confirm an
  algorithm matches and to compare numerics/perf â not copied verbatim. License
  is not a constraint on this project; the driver is modern, maintainable,
  fast C++20.
- **Balance maintainability Â· readability Â· performance.** Prefer clear,
  well-named, `constexpr`/`span`/`concepts`-friendly C++20 with documented
  algorithms and low cognitive complexity (systems band â¤ 25â35 for irreducible
  geometry, flagged). Optimise with data (benchmarks), not guesswork.

## Verification model (every capability)

Native code has **no OCCT dependency**, which gives two independent test gates:

1. **Host unit tests** â native code compiles and unit-tests with `clang++`
   `-std=c++20` (no OCCT, no simulator): analytic/known-value assertions
   (a known BÃ©zier point, a transform identity, an exact volume).
2. **Simulator native-vs-OCCT parity** â on the iOS simulator (OCCT linked), the
   native result is compared against the **OCCT oracle** at sampled inputs within
   a tight tolerance (fp64 for exact modelling). OCCT reference source lives at
   `/Users/leonardoaraujo/work/OCCT/src` (V8.0).

A capability is **migrated** only when: host unit tests pass, native-vs-OCCT
parity passes on the simulator, **and every existing suite stays green**
(`run-sim-suite.sh` 221/221, host CTest, GPU/Phase-3 suites). Then the engine's
active implementation for that capability is switched native, OCCT kept as a
fallback/oracle until the whole phase completes, and OCCT is unlinked only at
the final `drop-occt` step.

## Architecture

Native code lands under `src/native/` (host-buildable, OCCT-free). A
`NativeEngine : IEngine` implements each capability as it matures and **falls
through to the OCCT engine** for capabilities not yet native (the coexistence the
engine-adapter was built for) â so the app keeps working throughout, behind the
unchanged `cc_*` facade.

```
cc_* facade â active engine
                ââ NativeEngine (C++20)  ââ implements migrated capabilities
                â        ââ falls through to â for the rest
                ââ OcctEngine            ââ oracle + fallback (unlinked at the end)
```

## Capability sequence

Dependency order. Each row is one OpenSpec change (`add-native-*`).

> #5 SSI → curved-booleans implementation plan: see [SSI-ROADMAP.md](SSI-ROADMAP.md) (staged S1-S5, substrate #2 done; S1 analytic + S2 seeding + S3 marching done — the SSI curve pipeline is now NATIVE for transversal freeform/quadric pairs; **S5-a/b/c/d landed eight native curved-boolean sub-cases** verified vs OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_{Fuse,Cut,Common}` — the through-drill cyl∩cyl COMMON (S5-a) + FUSE + CUT (S5-b), the sphere∩sphere op-set now COMPLETE 3/3 native COMMON + FUSE + CUT (S5-c, equal + unequal radii), and the **branched-trace Steinmetz bicylinder COMMON (S5-d)** — all watertight, ΔV ≤ 9e-4 (sim `native-pass=10`); `ssi_boolean.{h,cpp}`, changes `add-native-ssi-curved-boolean` + `add-native-ssi-curved-boolean-wider` + `add-native-ssi-branched-boolean` (archived `2026-07-05`) + `complete-sphere-sphere-fuse-cut` (archived `2026-07-06`). **S5-c FUSE/CUT** reuse one generalised `appendSphereCap(outer,reversed)`: FUSE (A∪B) = the two OUTER (far-pole) caps welded on the shared seam (`V=V(A)+V(B)−lens`); CUT (A−B, order-sensitive) = the OUTER cap of A + the INNER cap of B emitted REVERSED (inward normal, bounding the scooped cavity) (`V=V(A)−lens`) — verified vs BOTH the analytic closed forms AND OCCT (FUSE ΔV 6.5e-04 eq / 8.3e-04 uneq; CUT ΔV 7.0e-04 eq / 9.3e-04 uneq); the COMMON path is byte-identical (defaults `outer=false,reversed=false`); tangent/containment/concentric pairs decline → NULL → OCCT. **S5-d** is the branched-trace assembler: on the S4 decline edge, a `steinmetzPreGate` (equal-R, orthogonal, crossing cylinders) triggers a branch-enabled re-trace, `recogniseSteinmetzTrace` accepts only the canonical 2-branch-point / 4-`BranchArc` structure, and `buildSteinmetzCommon` splits each cylinder along its arcs into the inside-the-other lune patches and welds the four into one watertight shell sharing the arc seams + the two branch-point vertices (S5-a planar-facet + `VertexPool` weld). Verified vs **BOTH** the exact analytic `16 R³/3 = 5.33333` (host) **and** OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_Common` (sim): volN = 5.3287, ΔV = 8.75e-04 (−0.088%), ΔA = 4.68e-04, inside the 1% bar; no tolerance weakened. **Steinmetz FUSE/CUT remain deferred → OCCT (honest NULL)** — only `Op::Common` dispatches to the branched builder (sphere∩sphere FUSE/CUT are now native — see S5-c above). S4-a/b classification + S4-c near-tangent march-through + **S4-d branch-point slice** (the Steinmetz self-crossing bicylinder localized + routed through both branch points vs OCCT `IntPatch`/`GeomAPI_IntSS` — 2 branch pts, 4 arms → 2 crossing ellipses; isolated tangent point still ends; `add-native-ssi-s4d-branch-points` archived) + **S4-e chart-singularity slice** (a marched curve crossing a sphere parametric pole `v=±π/2` or a cone apex — where ONE surface's own `(u,v)` degenerates while its point+normal stay finite — now FULLY traced vs OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS`: sphere great circle `singX=2 len 6.2829 vs 6.2832`, cone apex `singX=1` both nappes, on-surface ≤ 1.5e-07; `add-native-ssi-s4e-singularities` archived `2026-07-05`). **S4-f COMPLETENESS + LOOP-ROBUSTNESS slice** (hardens curves already traced, adds no new capability): loop-closure is now a TRUE-RETURN test (return to seed AND tangent-continuous AND arc past the closure window) so a near-pass no longer FALSE-CLOSES; a self-intersection guard detects + traces THROUGH a single-arm figure-eight crossing as typed data (`branchPts=0`, distinct from S4-d); an adaptive completeness-critic re-seed recovers small loops the fixed 1/32 subdivision misses (fixture A recall 0.50→1.00 floor 1/128, adversarial many-loops D 0.25→1.00 floor 1/48, both vs OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS`, every recovered node on both surfaces ≤ 1e-11) — **completeness is MEASURED per-fixture at the reached floor, NOT a proof (below ANY fixed resolution a smaller loop can still be missed); S4-f RAISES the recall floor and de-risks (does NOT unblock) curved blends #6 + wrap-emboss #7**; `add-native-ssi-s4f-completeness` archived `2026-07-05`. Remaining: **S4 general/freeform branch points + general/freeform + higher-order-cusp singularities + S4-f general small-loop residual (below the reached floor) + self-intersection arc-splitting/topology repair** + wider S5 coverage (Steinmetz fuse/cut, general non-Steinmetz branched pairs, more curved-curved families)).
| 6 | `add-native-fillets-offsets` | `native-blends` | hard | `BRepFilletAPI`, `BRepOffsetAPI` |
| 7 | `add-native-data-exchange` | `native-exchange` | moderate (external?) | `STEPControl`, `IGESControl` |
| 8 | `drop-occt` | â | â | unlink OCCT; kernel fully native |

Booleans (#5) are the hardest and longest-lived OCCT dependency â sequenced late
and expected to iterate. The PLANAR-polyhedron slice is now native (BSP-CSG,
self-verified EXACT vs OCCT on axis-aligned boxes); curved / general booleans remain
OCCT-backed. #7 (STEP/IGES) may stay a thin external dependency
longest; a native exchange is lower priority than the modelling core.

## Status

- â **#1 `native-math`** â done at the verification bar (first capability). Both
  gates green: host analytic unit tests (55 asserts, no OCCT) + native-vs-OCCT
  parity on the iOS sim (24 groups, 0 failed, overall max numeric error
  1.486e-13, well under tolerance); no regressions (host CTest 8/8,
  `run-sim-suite.sh` 221/221). Not yet engine-wired â by design, this capability
  ships the OCCT-free math foundation only. See

- â **#2 `native-topology`** â done at the verification bar (second capability).
  Both gates green: host invariant unit tests (`test_native_topology`, 13 cases,
  no OCCT â data model, orientation compose, location, sub-shape sharing,
  geometry attachment, stable ids, deterministic enumeration, explorer/ancestry,

  sim (3 shapes â box / cylinder / filleted-box â Ã 5 checks = **15 passed, 0
  failed**; sub-shape counts + `MapShapes` order + edgeâfaces ancestry +
  orientation flags match the oracle, accessor max error **0.000e+00** at tol
  1.0e-09, surface types match). No regressions (host CTest 9/9,
  `run-sim-suite.sh` 221/221). Header-only under `src/native/topology/`
  (`shape.h`, `explore.h`, `accessors.h`, `native_topology.h`); not engine-wired â

  [`docs/STATUS-phase-4.md`](../docs/STATUS-phase-4.md); living spec archived to
  `openspec/specs/native-topology`.
- â **#3 `native-tessellation`** â done at the verification bar (third
  capability). Both gates green: host invariant unit tests
  (`test_native_tessellate`, no OCCT â deflection-bound, on-surface, trimming,
  watertightness, area/volume convergence, determinism) + native-vs-OCCT
  `BRepMesh` property-parity on the iOS sim (4 shapes â box / cylinder / sphere /

  `solid_mesher.h`, `gpu_sample.h`, `native_tessellate.h`); not engine-wired â by
  design. RESOLVED: the curved shared-edge stitch â the mesher is now a two-stage
  pipeline (STAGE 1 `edge_mesher.h` discretizes each unique edge ONCE into a shared
  deflection-based 1D fraction list; STAGE 2 `face_mesher.h` pins both adjacent
  faces' boundaries to that shared discretization, structured-grid for full
  parametric-rectangle faces and ear-clip (`uv_triangulate.h`) for trimmed faces),
  so CURVED shared edges (cylinder capâside circle, fillet blend seams) weld
  WATERTIGHT â every closed solid (box/cylinder/sphere/filleted-box) is now
  required to mesh `boundaryEdges==0`; the weaker "bounded-open" pass is gone.

- â **#4 `native-construction`** â **CORE done at the verification bar; advanced
  swept solids are a follow-up (`#4b`).** The first **engine-wired** capability. Two
  construction ops are native: `cc_solid_extrude` (closed polygon â prism: bottom/top
  `Plane` caps + one planar quad `Plane` side per profile edge) and `cc_solid_revolve`
  for **LINE-SEGMENT** profiles (per-segment surface of revolution â parallelâ`Cylinder`,
  perpendicularâ`Plane`, obliqueâ`Cone`; full 360Â° closes the shell, partial angle adds
  two `Plane` meridian caps). Built on the #1â#3 foundations under
  `src/native/construct/construct.h` (OCCT-free, host-buildable). Wired through
  `NativeEngine : IEngine` (`src/engine/native/`), which serves these ops + native
  tessellate / mass / bbox / subshape on its own native bodies and **falls through to
  OCCT** (or the stub on host) for everything else, behind an ADDITIVE facade toggle
  `cc_set_engine(int)` / `cc_active_engine()` (**default stays OCCT** â existing suites
  unchanged). Both gates green: host `test_native_construct` + `test_native_engine`
  (no OCCT â box exact vol/area/6-faces/centroid/bbox/watertight, triangle prism
  watertight vol=areaÃdepth, L-prism, full-turn tube 9Ï, quarter-turn tube 9Ï/4, cone
  4Ï; CTest **12/12**) + native-vs-OCCT parity on the iOS sim through the facade
  (`native_construct_parity.mm`, **17/17** `[NCONS]`): planar prisms EXACT (vol/area/
  centroid rel 0.00e+00, identical face tiling), curved revolves within a deflection
  bound (vol rel â¤ 2.36e-2, area rel â¤ 1.24e-2, bbox maxCornerÎ â¤ 4.37e-2, all
  watertight), plus a fall-through boolean (nativeâOCCT, fuse vol=14) proving no native
  interception. No regressions (host CTest 12/12, `run-sim-suite.sh` 221/221 re-verified
  against a freshly rebuilt SIMULATORARM64 slice). Documented representational difference
  (not a geometric mismatch): the native builder emits per-face edges / per-patch vertices
  (edge/vertex SHARING deferred) and tiles a full-turn surface of revolution into < Ï
  angular patches (periodic-face construction deferred), so native V/E and the full-turn
  face count differ from OCCT's shared/periodic representation while the SOLID is
  geometrically identical. See [`docs/STATUS-phase-4.md`](../docs/STATUS-phase-4.md);
  living spec archived to `openspec/specs/native-construction`.
  - **â `#4b` follow-up â Tier A + Tier B (2-section ruled loft) DONE at the
    verification bar; the rest still OCCT-fallthrough (not faked).** NOW NATIVE
    (host-verified, engine-wired behind the same `cc_set_engine(1)` toggle):
    `cc_solid_extrude_holes` (outer polygon +
    CIRCULAR through-holes kept as TRUE circle edges + cylinder walls),
    `cc_solid_extrude_polyholes` (outer + POLYGON holes), `cc_solid_extrude_profile` /
    `_profile_polyholes` (TYPED outer profile â kind 0 line / 1 arc / 2 full circle â
    with circular + polygon holes; a whole-circle profile keeps one Circle cap edge +
    one Cylinder wall), and `cc_solid_revolve_profile` (TYPED profile revolve: line â
    Plane/Cylinder/Cone, an arc whose circle centre lies ON the axis â Sphere band;
    full 2Ï closes, partial adds two planar meridian caps). **Tier B:**
    `cc_solid_loft` / `cc_solid_loft_wires` for TWO sections with EQUAL vertex counts
    (â¥3) that are both PLANAR â corresponding edge pairs span one BILINEAR (degree-1
    BÃ©zier) ruled side face + two planar caps â watertight solid (mirrors ruled
    `BRepOffsetAPI_ThruSections`); built in `src/native/construct/loft.h` (OCCT-FREE,
    host-buildable, all functions cognitive complexity â¤ 7). Built in
    `src/native/construct/profile.h` (OCCT-FREE, host-buildable) + a robustified
    multi-hole cap triangulator (visibility-checked, rightmost-first hole bridging in
    `src/native/tessellate/uv_triangulate.h`, replacing the single-hole-only nearest-
    vertex heuristic). Gate 1 green: host `test_native_profile` (12 cases â circular /
    polygon / multi-hole / combined holes watertight with exact-or-convergent volume;
    full-circle extrude â cylinder; on-axis arc revolve â sphere 36Ï; partial-turn
    revolve; typed line/arc extrude) + `test_native_engine` (5 new facade cases through
    `cc_solid_extrude_holes/_polyholes/_profile` + `cc_solid_revolve_profile`); host
    CTest 13/13, existing suites incl. `test_native_tessellate` unchanged. STILL
    OCCT-fallthrough (the native builder returns a NULL Shape â `NativeEngine` forwards
    to OCCT, never fakes): **kind-3 SPLINE profile edges** (extrude AND revolve),
    **arc-revolve whose circle centre is OFF the axis** (a TORUS surface of revolution
    â no native Torus surface yet), a loft with MISMATCHED section counts / a
    NON-PLANAR section / 3+ sections / guided or rail loft (Tier C), and
    twisted-with-real-twist / guided-sweep / loft-along-rail / threads (Tiers CâE).
    (`cc_solid_sweep` itself is NOW native for straight + smooth-planar spines â see the
    Tier-C entry below.) A
    kind-1 ARC extrude edge is a TRUE `Circle` cap edge + a `Cylinder` side wall â one
    bounded, non-periodic patch per â¤180Â° span (split threshold is Ï for the EXTRUDE
    wall, NOT the revolve's 120Â°: an extrude wall is never periodic, so a semicircle is
    ONE patch matching OCCT's single cylindrical face) â not a chord polyline. Gate 2
    (sim OCCT parity) GREEN: `native_construct_profiles_parity.mm` through the cc_*
    facade, **22 passed / 0 failed** â the 5 native ops (holed / polyhole / typed
    line+arc / line-revolve tube / on-axis-arc-revolve sphere) match the OCCT oracle
    (planar EXACT; curved deflection-bounded vol rel â¤ 5.0e-2, all watertight; native
    FACE count a kâ¥1 integer multiple of OCCT's), and the 2 deferred sub-cases (kind-3
    spline extrude, off-axis-circle â torus revolve) transparently delegate to OCCT
    (vol rel 0.00e+00). Note: `splineXYCount` on the kind-3 side-channel is the number
    of DOUBLES (2Ã the point count), matching the OCCT `addSplineEdge` bounds guard â
    now documented in `cc_kernel.h`. **Tier B (2-section ruled loft):** Gate 1 (host,
    no OCCT) GREEN â `test_native_loft` (9 cases: prism / frustum / twisted rotated
    square / two-3D-wire triangle prism / tilted planar section watertight, + deferred
    mismatched-count / non-planar / degenerate / bad-input all NULL) + 2 new
    `test_native_engine` facade cases (native square-frustum loft vol 56 @ 6 faces;
    native `loft_wires` triangle prism vol 18); CTest **14/14**, `loft.h` cognitive
    complexity â¤ 7 across all functions. Gate 2 (sim OCCT parity) GREEN â
    `tests/sim/native_loft_parity.mm` + `scripts/run-sim-native-loft.sh` through the
    `cc_*` facade under `cc_set_engine(0/1)` (OCCT default restored in teardown):
    **`[NLOFT]` 17 passed / 0 failed** â square frustum (vol rel 2.54e-16) / hex
    prism (rel 0.00e+00) / two-wire triangle prism (rel 0.00e+00) EXACT,
    rotated-square TWIST deflection-bounded (vol rel 5.33e-3, watertight, tol 5e-2),
    native F = OCCT F (n=1Ão) on all four, plus the mismatched-count deferred case
    delegating to OCCT (vol rel 0.00e+00, native active â fall-through proof). Runs
    on the sim (OCCT linked); on `run-sim-suite.sh`'s SKIP list (own `main()`), so
    the 221-assertion suite count is unchanged. No regressions (`test_native_tessellate`
    green, `run-sim-suite.sh` 221/221).
  - **â `#4b` Tier C (sweep / pipe-shell) â `cc_solid_sweep` DONE at the verification
    bar; the guided/rail/real-twist pipe-shell cases stay OCCT-fallthrough (not faked).**
    NOW NATIVE (engine-wired behind the same `cc_set_engine(1)` toggle):
    `cc_solid_sweep` for (a) a **STRAIGHT** spine (exact directional prism, vol =
    profileArea Ã |d|) and (b) a **SMOOTH CURVED but PLANAR** spine. The crux â and the
    fix that made Gate 2 pass â is the FRAME LAW: the OCCT oracle
    `BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipe` uses `GeomFill_CorrectedFrenet`, which for a **planar** spine
    collapses to a **constant rotation** (`GeomFill_CorrectedFrenet.cxx`, `isPlanar` â
    `Law_Constant`), i.e. it TRANSLATES the section with a FIXED orientation, NOT a
    perpendicular-tracking sweep. So `src/native/construct/sweep.h` holds the start frame
    CONSTANT across stations (`detail::constantFrames`), builds one bilinear ruled band
    per (profile edge Ã spine segment) with shared per-station rings, and caps both ends
    in the fixed section plane â a watertight solid. (An earlier RMF / parallel-transport
    revision kept the section perpendicular and produced the Pappus arc-length volume â
    geometrically "nicer" but a REAL mismatch vs the oracle, correctly rejected by the
    parity gate; we match the oracle.) `cc_twisted_sweep` is native ONLY when it reduces
    to the plain sweep (twist â 0, scale â 1 â forwards to `build_sweep`). Gate 1 green:
    host `test_native_sweep` (11 cases â straight prism / collinear-collapse / arbitrary-
    3D-direction / pentagon / zero-twist prism / smooth-planar-arc watertight + constant-
    frame volume `AÂ·|ÎspineÂ·nÌ|` / constant-frame invariance / degenerate + real-twist +
    tight-curvature deferrals) + `test_native_engine` (`native_sweep_smooth_arc` vol
    82.57 = the oracle value, `native_sweep_tight_and_twisted_defer`); host CTest 15/15,
    existing suites unchanged. STILL OCCT-fallthrough (native builder returns NULL â
    `NativeEngine` forwards, never fakes): a **NON-PLANAR** curved spine (OCCT's genuine
    non-constant corrected-Frenet law), a **TIGHT-CURVATURE / self-intersecting** spine
    (guarded by `spineTooSharp`), a **real-twist/scale** `cc_twisted_sweep` (OCCT
    `ThruSections`), and the pipe-shell/guide cases **`cc_guided_sweep`** /
    **`cc_loft_along_rail`** (engine-glue fall-through). Gate 2 (sim OCCT parity) GREEN:
    `tests/sim/native_sweep_parity.mm` + `scripts/run-sim-native-sweep.sh` through the
    `cc_*` facade under `cc_set_engine(0/1)` â **`[NSWEEP]` 11 passed / 0 failed**: the
    straight sweep EXACT (vol rel 7e-16) and â because native and OCCT now share the same
    constant-frame law and polyline â the **smooth-arc sweep EXACT too** (vol o=330.299
    n=330.299 **rel 1.7e-16**, bbox maxCornerÎ 1.0e-7, native F = OCCT F = 98, watertight),
    plus the three deferred cases (real-twist / guided / loft-rail) delegating to OCCT
    (vol rel 0.00e+00, native active â fall-through proof). On `run-sim-suite.sh`'s SKIP
    list (own `main()`), 221-assertion count unchanged. No regressions (host CTest 15/15,
    `run-sim-suite.sh` 221/221). Living change: `openspec/changes/add-native-sweep`.
  - **â `#4b` Tier D (threads / tapered shank) â ALL THREE NATIVE at the Gate-1 bar:
    `cc_tapered_shank`, `cc_helical_thread`, `cc_tapered_thread`.** Engine-wired behind
    the same `cc_set_engine(1)` toggle. **`cc_tapered_shank`** â a pointed-shank silhouette
    (cone tip â full-radius cylinder â head disk) revolved 360Â° about Z by REUSING the
    already-parity-verified native revolve (`build_revolution`, construct.h). The tip is
    a TRUE on-axis apex (the revolve collapses its angular copies to one shared vertex, so
    no sliver breaks the weld â a non-zero tip radius does NOT weld, verified), giving a
    ROBUSTLY watertight solid at every deflection {0.05â¦0.005} with volume
    `âÏ rÂ²Â·taperHeight + Ï rÂ²Â·fullHeight` within the deflection bound (r5/fh20/th10 â
    exact 1832.6, meshed 1828â1832), matching `BRepPrimAPI_MakeRevol`. Built in
    `src/native/construct/thread.h` (OCCT-FREE, host-buildable, all four functions
    cognitive complexity ð¢ Excellent â¤ 5). **`cc_helical_thread` / `cc_tapered_thread`
    (NOW NATIVE):** the full radial-V helical tiling â a V/triangular section transported
    RADIALLY along the pitch-line helix via the AXIS auxiliary-spine law
    (radial = (cosÎ¸,sinÎ¸,0), axial = +Z, so the V does NOT Frenet-rotate â mirroring
    `BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell::SetMode(axisWire,true)`), tiled into three bilinear ruled
    bands per span (loft.h `ruledSideFace`) with shared per-station rings + two planar V
    end caps, capped at `samplesPerTurn â [8,24]` and GUARDED against self-intersection
    (pitch-line radius must clear the axis at both ends; `2Â·halfBase â¤ pitch`; degenerate
    params â NULL). **The per-turn seam WELD was the last blocker and is now fixed at the
    mesher level (topology-preferred, geometry untouched):** the ruled-band â band and
    band â V-cap seams are STRAIGHT edges shared by two faces that each evaluated the seam
    through their OWN bilinear surface, so the two boundary points agreed only to ~1 ULP;
    when a shared coordinate landed on a spatial-weld cell boundary (coordÂ·âtol = k+0.5)
    the ULP twins rounded to opposite cells and the weld left the seam OPEN at isolated
    deflections. The mesher now emits, for every straight boundary edge, CANONICAL seam
    points â interpolated at the shared sample indices `i/n` between the edge's two
    BOUNDING VERTICES in a fixed lexicographic order (`edge_mesher.h` `CanonicalEndpoints`
    / `face_mesher.h` `recordEdgeAnchors`), which is BIT-IDENTICAL for the two coincident
    edges regardless of build order â and SNAPS each seam-lying vertex to its canonical
    point (`BoundaryAnchors`). The two faces therefore place the identical 3D point and the
    conservative single-cell weld fuses them, with NO widening of the merge radius (which
    would over-collapse a fine curvature grid). This is exactly the "one shared 1D
    discretization pinned on both faces" contract, completed at the 3D-point level; the V
    volume/geometry are unchanged. Result: helical (major6â¦20 / pitch2â¦4 / turns1â¦5 /
    depth0.5â¦1.5 / spt8â¦24) and tapered (top5â¦8 / tip3â¦4 / â¦) are ROBUSTLY watertight
    (`boundaryEdges==0`) at EVERY deflection in the `robustlyWatertight` ladder across the
    full swept parameter space (432/432 helical + 96/96 tapered candidates â native), so
    the engine keeps them NATIVE. **HONESTY (unchanged guard):** a FINE-PITCH /
    self-intersecting thread (turns fold through each other, e.g. major2/pitch0.2/depth3)
    still fails `robustlyWatertight` â a self-overlapping mesh is non-manifold no matter
    how the vertices weld â so it still FALLS THROUGH to the OCCT `MakePipeShell` oracle
    (labelled, verified, never faked; the native builder never emits the round-profile
    fallback). Gate 1 (host, no OCCT) GREEN â `test_native_thread` (9 cases: shank watertight+volume,

    OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS`. Additive to `marching.cpp`, gated `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`; no `cc_*`.
    Four levers: **(1) fixed-plane-cut corrector** — inside the band the S3 along-`t`
    advance residual (`t = normalize(nA×nB)` ill-conditions as `sine → 0`) is replaced by a
    cut on the plane perpendicular to the **last-good forward tangent `t★`**, so the
    `least_squares` solve stays well-posed where the local surface tangent degenerates;
    **(2) curvature-aware predictor** — bends `P + h·t★` by the discrete two-node curvature
    so the corrector starts in-basin across the sharp bend; **(3) fine deflection-bounded
    step** through the low-sine band (capped `h₀/16`, `minStep` floor, `crossMaxSteps`
    budget) so it RESOLVES the region rather than leaping it; **(4) crossable gate (honesty
    core)** — crosses ONLY a `NearTangentTransversal` single-branch graze; a steep-sine-
    collapse witness (stall sine < ¼ last-good) OR a band-minimum-floor scan (fine
    look-ahead min sine < `0.3·tangentSinTol`) forces a DEFER, so a branch saddle / genuine
    `TangentPoint`/`TangentCurve`/`Undecided` STILL stops + classifies + defers → OCCT. No
    point is fabricated past a degeneracy: a crossed arc is emitted only if EVERY node
    verified on both surfaces ≤ `onSurfTol`, else the whole arc is discarded (rollback).
    **At the bar:** a sphere grazed by an offset cylinder that S3 TRUNCATES at
    `tangentSinTol=0.25` now traces the FULL closed loop (`nearTangentGaps → 0`,
    `nearTangentCrossed = 22` nodes, every node on both surfaces ≤ 1e-6, crossed arc on the
    OCCT locus onCurve ≤ 5.6e-5 / onSurf ≤ 1.3e-5 / crossResid ≤ 4.1e-11); the equal-radius
    orthogonal-cylinder **saddle (a branch crossing) STILL DEFERS** (`nearTangentCrossed=0`,
    `nearTangentGaps ≥ 1`), as do genuine `TangentPoint`/`TangentCurve` contacts. All 5 S3
    transversal fixtures trace bit-identically (corrector/step outside the band unchanged).
    Both gates green: host `test_native_ssi_marching` (**10 cases, 0 failed**; NUMSCI OFF
    CTest **26/26**, NUMSCI ON **31/31**) + sim `scripts/run-sim-native-ssi-s4c.sh`

  - **SSI Stage S4-d (BRANCH POINTS — self-crossing locus) — FIRST HONEST SLICE DONE at the
    verification bar (both gates).** The hardest SSI piece: where the intersection LOCUS
    itself crosses (multiple curve arms meet at one point), LOCALIZE the branch point,
    ENUMERATE the outgoing arms, ROUTE each and ASSEMBLE the multi-arm curve — verified vs
    OCCT `IntPatch`/`GeomAPI_IntSS`. Additive to `marching.cpp` + new `branch_point.h`, gated
    `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, default-on `enableBranchPoints`; no `cc_*`. Fires **exactly where
    S4-c would have deferred** (the steep-sine-collapse + tangent-flip witness). Four steps:
    **(1) LOCALIZE** — `nn::minimize` the transversality sine `g(s) = ‖nA×nB‖` along the
    bracketed approach (each trial re-projected onto both surfaces with the S4-c fixed-plane
    corrector), then a full `nn::least_squares` re-project of the minimum onto both surfaces;
    accepted only if `‖A−B‖ ≤ onSurfTol` and the sine is at/near the floor, else DEFER (no
    fabricated B). **(2) ENUMERATE ARMS** — build the shared tangent-plane basis at B, form
    the relative second fundamental form `H = II_A − II_B`, solve the tangent-cone quadratic:
    discriminant `Δ > 0` ⇒ TWO distinct real tangent lines ⇒ up to four world-space rays;
    `Δ ≤ 0` ⇒ EMPTY (definite ⇒ isolated `TangentPoint`, END; double root ⇒ cusp, out of
    scope, DEFER). **Never fabricates a ray** — the same discriminant sign as S4-b's
    `TangentPoint` classification enforces "an isolated tangent point still ends". **(3)
    ROUTE** — step `h₀/8` off B along each real ray, S4-c-correct back onto both surfaces,
    then run the normal S3 walk to termination; drop the arm if `S₀` fails on-both-surfaces
    or the march makes no progress. **(4) ASSEMBLE** — dedup arms that retrace a kept arm
    (`retraces`), merge their shared branch-point connectivity into the `BranchNode`
    (`point`, `branchSine`, `armLineIds`), `++branchPoints`. A branch not robustly
    localizable/enumerable/routable STOPS + defers **exactly as S4-c** (a `NearTangent` WLine
    in `nearTangentGaps`). **At the bar:** the **Steinmetz bicylinder** (two equal-R=1
    orthogonal cylinders) that S3+S4-c TRUNCATE at the saddle (one `NearTangent` WLine,
    `branchPoints=0`) is now FULLY traced: `branchPoints=2` localized at `(0,±1,0)` (branch
    sine ≈ 5e-8 / 9e-8, re-projection residual ≈ 5e-13), 4 `BranchArc` arms assembled into
    the two crossing ellipses, `nearTangentGaps=0`, every node on both cylinders ≤ `onSurfTol`;
    sim parity vs OCCT `eq-cyl s4d branchPts=2 traced=4 arms=3 onCurve=1.74e-6 onSurf=1.07e-8`
    (both branch points match the OCCT saddles at `(0,±1,0)`). The isolated `TangentPoint`
    (spheres `d=R₁+R₂`) STILL ENDS with zero arms; the S4-c graze still crosses
    (`crossed=22`); the flag-off eq-cyl control still defers; the 5 transversal pairs stay
    `nt=0` bit-identical. Both gates green: host `test_native_ssi_marching` (**12 cases, 0
    failed**; NUMSCI OFF CTest **26/26**, NUMSCI ON **31/31**) + sim

    `native-pass=5` persists, tessellator byte-identical, `src/native/**` OCCT-free).
    **Honest scope — what S4-d does NOT do:** only the elementary two-real-distinct-line
    **transversal self-crossing** (Steinmetz family) is traced; general/freeform branch
    points, three-plus tangent lines, cusps (double root) and S4-f self-intersection
    completeness DEFER → OCCT, reported with the measured gap, never faked (the **S4-e chart

  - **SSI Stage S4-e (CHART SINGULARITIES — sphere pole + cone apex) — FIRST HONEST SLICE
    DONE at the verification bar (both gates).** A **chart (removable) singularity** is where
    ONE surface's own `(u,v)` parametrization degenerates (`‖dU‖ → 0`) while its 3D point +
    normal stay finite — a **sphere parametric pole** (`v = ±π/2`) or a **cone apex** (signed
    radius `= 0`). The intersection can be perfectly TRANSVERSAL through it (the pair sine need
    NOT collapse), yet S3 breaks: `advanceParams` solves each surface's single-surface 2×2
    normal equations, and the vanishing `dU` row makes that 2×2 rank-1, so the `(u,v)` update
    is ill-conditioned even though the 3D residual + normal are fine (and the pole sits on a
    non-periodic `v` edge → spurious `BoundaryExit` / apex step-crawl). Additive to
    `marching.cpp` + new OCCT-free `chart_singularity.h`, gated `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, default-
    **off** `enableChartSingularities`; no `cc_*`. **(1) single-surface chart witness** —
    `chartConditionAt` finite-differences each surface's `‖dU‖` vs `‖dV‖·scale`; a collapse
    with a finite normal flags a pole/apex on THAT surface — computed from ONE surface's own
    Jacobian, DISTINCT from the S4-c pair sine and the S4-d locus-tangent flip, and a finite
    cap keeps a genuine domain boundary from being mistaken for a pole. **(2) point-based
    fixed-plane-cut crossing** — at a collapse, `crossChartSingularity` makes bounded fine
    POINT-BASED jumps along the fixed last-good tangent `t★` (the branch_point.h / S4-c cut),
    which never touches the degenerate `dU`, so it stays well-posed where `advanceParams`
    failed. **(3) loose chart map-back** — the sphere pole continues on the opposite meridian
    (`u_out = u_in + π mod 2π`), the cone apex is a single 3D point the curve passes through to
    the far nappe (`v → −v`); the singular point itself is never emitted. **(4) honest guard**
    — a node is emitted ONLY if it verifies on BOTH surfaces ≤ `onSurfTol` with real along-`t★`
    progress; on ANY failure the band is DISCARDED (roll back) and the march STOPS + defers →
    OCCT as a `NearTangent` gap (`nearTangentGaps`). No pole/apex point is ever fabricated.
    Both gates green: host `test_native_ssi_s4e_singularities` (**5 cases, 0 failed**; NUMSCI
    OFF CTest **26/26** with the S4-e suite correctly ABSENT, NUMSCI ON CTest **32/32**) + sim
    native-vs-OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` parity (`scripts/run-sim-native-ssi-marching.sh`,

    locus + both surfaces ≤ 1.51e-07; the double-cone `∩` plane line through the **apex** (S3
    step-collapsed at `v ≈ −0.04`) is **FULLY traced across both nappes** — `cone-apex s4e
    singX=1 NTgaps=0 nodes=159`, `v ∈ [−2.00, +2.00]`, on-locus 7.11e-16 / on-surface 6.79e-16.
    A genuine finite cylinder `v`-cap still exits as a `BoundaryExit` (chart machinery does NOT
    misfire). No regressions: the 5 transversal pairs stay `nt = 0` bit-identical, the S4-c
    graze still `crossed = 22`, the S4-d Steinmetz still `branchPts = 2 traced = 4`, S5
    `native-pass = 6` persists, tessellator byte-identical. **Honest scope:** only the two
    elementary chart singularities (sphere pole + cone apex) are crossed; **general / freeform
    parametric singularities** (NURBS degenerate edges, collapsed spline poles), **higher-order
    / curve cusps**, and **S4-f self-intersection completeness** remain DEFERRED → OCCT with the

    verification bar (both gates).** The S4-d branched trace is now turned into a native
    BOOLEAN: the Steinmetz bicylinder COMMON. On the S4 decline edge (`nearTangentGaps > 0`,
    no usable single seam) a cheap `steinmetzPreGate` (both `Cylinder`, `|rA−rB| ≤ tol`, axes
    orthogonal + crossing) RE-TRACES with `MarchOptions.enableBranchPoints = true`;
    `recogniseSteinmetzTrace` accepts the branched `TraceSet` ONLY when canonical
    (`nearTangentGaps == 0`, `branchPoints == 2`, exactly four `BranchArc` arms, each arm's
    endpoints coincident with the two branch-node points) — anything else → NULL → OCCT.
    `buildSteinmetzCommon` splits each cylinder wall along its two arcs into the inside-the-other
    lune patches (planar-triangle strips walked branch-to-branch in lockstep, every interior
    sample on the analytic cylinder), keeps the four whose centroid is inside the other cylinder,
    and welds them into ONE watertight shell through a single `VertexPool` — both sides of every
    arc and all four arcs at each branch point draw the SAME pooled nodes (the two branch-point
    vertices pooled once), seam-adjacent facets are planar triangles (S5-a discipline, no
    analytic face on a shared seam). The engine's existing `16 R³/3` oracle self-verifies and
    owns the OCCT fallback. **At the bar:** COMMON of two equal-R=1 orthogonal cylinders is
    non-NULL, watertight, enclosed volume 5.3287 vs the EXACT analytic `16/3 = 5.33333` **and**

  (1) native project-a-2D-pattern-onto-a-surface into the target face UV domain,
  (2) native offset-along-normal by the emboss depth, and (3) a boolean merge of the
  raised/recessed region with the base solid. Step (2) is now **unblocked by #6** â the
  native planar `cc_offset_face` (slide a planar face along its normal + drag the side
  faces, EXACT slab, self-verified vs OCCT) is exactly the planar offset-along-normal a
  PLANAR-face emboss/deboss needs; step (3) is **partially unblocked by #5** (a
  planar-polyhedron emboss/deboss can use the native BSP-CSG fuse/cut, and â with the
  curved analytic slice now archived â an AXIS-ALIGNED-CYLINDER target can use the native
  box-cylinder curved fuse/cut). So a **planar-target wrap-emboss is now reachable
  natively** (native offset from #6 + native planar boolean from #5), the **boolean step
  of an axis-aligned-cylinder-target wrap-emboss is now also native** (curved analytic
  slice of #5), and only a **general curved-surface** wrap-emboss still waits on the
  **general curved native-boolean slice of #5** plus a **curved-surface native offset** (the
  planar slice of #6 does not offset curved faces). Native wrap-emboss remains sequenced
  AFTER #6, as its own OpenSpec change (`/opsx:propose`) â the planar slice can be
  proposed now that #6 landed; the curved slice waits on curved #5 + curved offset. Until
  then `cc_wrap_emboss` stays OCCT-fallthrough (labelled, verified). Robust-watertight
  `cc_helical_thread`/`cc_tapered_thread` are **NO LONGER deferred** â the mesher
  shared-edge weld (edge_mesher `CanonicalEndpoints` / face_mesher `BoundaryAnchors`) is
  DONE, so a well-formed helical / tapered thread now meshes `boundaryEdges==0` at EVERY
  deflection in the `robustlyWatertight` ladder and runs NATIVE (see the Tier D entry
  above; `test_native_thread` asserts the hard multi-deflection watertight ladder and
  `test_native_engine::native_thread_runs_native_watertight` asserts the op runs native
  through the facade). Several other residual #4b natives are now DONE by the
  geometry-completion batch above â **kind-3 SPLINE profile edge extrude, off-axis-arc TORUS
  revolve, N-section (3+) ruled loft, and a NON-PLANAR (RMF) sweep are now NATIVE.** What is
  still OCCT-fallthrough are the cases that genuinely need SSI / Tier-4 (surface-surface
  intersection + trimming): the accumulating-twist/scale `cc_twisted_sweep`, the guided/rail
  cases (`cc_guided_sweep` / `cc_loft_along_rail` / hard-rail loft), a mismatched-count /
  non-planar loft, a truly self-intersecting sweep or thread, a general SPLINE
  surface-of-revolution, and a spindle torus.
- â **#6 `native-blends` â tractable PLANAR slice done at the verification bar (both
  gates green); curved / concave / variable / fillet_face OCCT-fallthrough (honest).** Native
  `cc_chamfer_edges` / `cc_fillet_edges` (constant radius) / `cc_offset_face` /
  `cc_shell` for the tractable planar cases, built OCCT-free under
  `src/native/blend/` (`blend_geom.h`, `chamfer_edges.h`, `fillet_edges.h`,
  `offset_face.h`, `shell.h`, aggregate `native_blend.h`). Each op edits the solid's
  oriented-planar-polygon soup (the boolean's `extractPolygons`) and re-welds a
  watertight solid via the boolean's `assembleSolid` (T-junction repair + triangulate
  + weld), so it meshes by the SAME path a native prism / boolean does; the engine
  then runs a MANDATORY self-verify (`blendResultVerified` â watertight + sane volume
  sign: chamfer/fillet/shell REDUCE volume, offset GROWS for +distance / shrinks for
  âdistance) and DISCARDS a bad candidate â OCCT (never a wrong/leaky/faked solid).
  Native: **chamfer** slices the convex corner off with the plane through the two
  setback lines (EXACT vs OCCT for a box corner â 10Â³ edge d=2 â vol 980);
  **fillet** replaces a convex planar-dihedral edge with the rolling-ball tangent
  cylinder (the Phase-3 dihedral construction â axis â¥ crease, radius r, seated
  tangent to both planes: C = E â r/(1+n1Â·n2)Â·(n1+n2), tangent lines Ti = C + rÂ·ni),
  tiled into deflection-bounded facets (vol 991.4, BETWEEN the sharp 1000 and the
  chamfer 980, watertight); **offset_face** slides a planar face along its normal
  dragging the side faces (EXACT slab â +5 â 1500, â4 â 600); **shell** insets the
  kept walls inward by thickness and native-BSP-cuts the cavity (open-top box t=1 â
  wall vol 424). Gate 1 GREEN â host `test_native_blend` (10 cases: chamfer box /
  2-edge exact + degenerate/curved fallthrough; fillet watertight-between +
  curved/degenerate fallthrough; offset grow/shrink exact; shell wall exact +
  oversize fallthrough; concave L-prism edge â NULL while a convex edge of the same
  prism still lands native) + 5 new `test_native_engine` facade cases (native
  chamfer/fillet/offset/shell through `cc_set_engine(1)` + a variable-radius
  deferral + a native `cc_edge_polylines` regression case) host CTest **18/18**. STILL
  OCCT-fallthrough (native builder
  returns NULL / self-verify discards â forwarded or honest error, never faked):
  CURVED-face inputs, CONCAVE edges, variable-radius `cc_fillet_edges_variable`,
  `cc_fillet_face`, an edge shared by â 2 faces, multi-edge fillet interference,
  non-convex shell, oversized thickness. Blend functions are ð¢ Excellent (â¤10)
  except the two op drivers `fillet_edges` (13) / `chamfer_edges` (11) in the
  ð¡ Acceptable band (systems-band per-edge loop, flagged). Gate 2 (sim native-vs-OCCT
  parity, `native_blend_parity.mm` vs BRepFilletAPI/BRepOffsetAPI) GREEN â **`[NBLEND]`
  16 passed / 0 failed** through the `cc_*` facade under `cc_set_engine(0/1)`: chamfer

  4.02e-16) EXACT + watertight, constant-radius fillet deflection-bounded (o=997.854
  n=997.765 rel 8.96e-05, watertight), the curved-rim fillet forwarded to OCCT
  (`[fallback]` rel 0.00e+00), and the self-verify guard rejecting a thickness-6 shell on
  a 10Â³ box (id 0, honest error). **Root-cause fix:** the NativeEngine had no native
  `edge_polylines` â a native body's edges were unqueryable (the op refused a native
  body), so `findAxisEdge` in the sim harness resolved edge id 0 and `cc_chamfer_edges`
  / `cc_fillet_edges` always returned 0. `NativeEngine::edge_polylines` now discretizes
  each edge (in `mapShapes(Edge)` 1-based order, matching `subshape_ids` / the blend
  ops' edge lookup) via the shared `EdgeCache`, so native-body edges are pickable exactly
  as OCCT-body edges are. On `run-sim-suite.sh`'s SKIP list (own `main()`); 221/221
  re-verified.
- **#6 `native-blends` -- FIRST CURVED-blend slice DONE at all gates: constant-radius
  rolling-ball fillet on a CIRCULAR crease (cylinder lateral <-> coaxial planar cap) ->
  TORUS canal, G1-tangent, verified vs OCCT `BRepFilletAPI`.** Extends the planar
  tangent-cylinder fillet to the first curved crease. A ball of radius `r` rolled into
  the convex circular rim (cylinder radius `Rc`, coaxial cap at axial `H`) stays tangent
  to both: its centre traces a circle of radius `Rc - r` at height `H - r` -- the
  tube-centre circle of a TORUS coaxial with the cylinder (major `R = Rc - r`, minor
  `r`). The blend surface is that torus's quarter-tube `v in [0, pi/2]`: at `v = 0` the
  point is at radius `Rc` with a RADIAL normal (tangent circle on the cylinder wall --
  `torus n cylinder`, an analytic SSI-S1 coaxial seam); at `v = pi/2` the point is at
  radius `Rc - r` with an AXIAL normal (tangent circle on the cap -- `torus n plane`). So
  the fillet is G1-tangent to the wall at `v=0` and to the cap at `v=pi/2` by
  construction. Built OCCT-FREE in `src/native/blend/curved_fillet.h` (reuses
  `blend_geom.h` + `math/torus.h` + boolean `assembleSolid`): it recognises the cyl<->cap
  rim by GEOMETRY (sole coaxial Cylinder at the rim radius + sole Plane through the rim
  perpendicular to the axis), resolves the cap + far-end axial heights, and rebuilds the
  whole filleted solid as one deflection-bounded planar-facet soup -- far cap, cylinder
  wall up to the wall seam, the torus quarter-tube (each curved quad SPLIT INTO TWO
  TRIANGLES so every facet is exactly planar and welds watertight), and the trimmed cap --
  all four parts sharing the SAME `N` angular samples so the wall->torus (`H-r`, `Rc`) and
  torus->cap (`H`, `Rc-r`) seams weld with coincident vertices. Requires a RING torus
  `Rc >= 2r` (else the tube self-intersects the axis -> NULL -> OCCT). Dispatched in
  `NativeEngine::fillet_edges` AFTER the planar path declines, then the MANDATORY
  `blendResultVerified` self-verify (watertight + `0 < Vr < Vo`) accepts it or discards ->
  OCCT. Gate 1 GREEN -- host `test_native_blend` adds the closed-form-volume assertion +
  `curved_fillet_g1_tangent_at_both_seams` (a pure-math check that the torus canal normal
  is exactly radial at `v=0` vs the cylinder normal and exactly axial at `v=pi/2` vs the
  cap normal, and the seam radii coincide -- ANALYTIC, no mesh, no OCCT). Gate 2 GREEN --
  `run-sim-native-curved-fillet.sh` **9/9** through the `cc_*` facade under
  `cc_set_engine(1)` (`activeNative=1`), native torus blend vs OCCT `BRepFilletAPI`:
  vol rel <= 3.8e-3, area rel <= 2.1e-3, watertight, mesh-vol == B-rep, across
  `Rc in {5,4,6}` incl. the `Rc=2r` ring-torus boundary; the reported `cos(wall seam)=1.0
  / cos(cap seam)=1.0` is the ANALYTIC G1 the construction guarantees (flagged
  analytic-not-mesh-sampled, honestly). STILL OCCT-fallthrough (NULL / self-verify
  discards, honest error, never faked): CONCAVE rims, VARIABLE radius, cyl<->cyl /
  cyl<->cone canal fillets, NON-circular curved creases (cone/sphere/ellipse/spline rim),
  freeform neighbours, `Rc < 2r` near-degenerate, multi-edge. Change

- **#7 `native-wrap-emboss` -- FIRST NATIVE slice DONE at all gates: emboss a RECTANGULAR
  pad onto a CYLINDER lateral face, verified vs OCCT `cc_wrap_emboss`.** The Phase-3
  `cc_wrap_emboss` (#290) stays the ORACLE; this adds a NATIVE path behind the same ABI.
  Built OCCT-FREE in `src/native/feature/wrap_emboss.h`: for `boss=1` (emboss) on a native
  solid whose picked face is a Cylinder wall, it wraps a closed 4-corner rectangular
  footprint by the SAME map the OCCT oracle uses (`u = px/R` arc-length->angle,
  `v = py + vMid` axial, `vMid` = wall's axial middle), then rebuilds the whole embossed
  solid as one deflection-bounded planar-facet soup -- the pad's OUTER CAP (cylinder patch
  at `R+height` over the footprint window), two CIRCUMFERENTIAL walls (planes perp to axis
  at `v=vMin,vMax`), two AXIAL walls (planes through the axis at `u=uMin,uMax`), and the
  base cylinder wall retiled over the FULL turn with the footprint window REMOVED -- every
  part sharing a common `u`-sample sequence (window arc = the first `nUwin` cells) so all
  seams weld watertight via the boolean `assembleSolid` (each curved quad SPLIT INTO TWO
  TRIANGLES, planar-facet discipline). Why a facet soup, not an SSI fuse: the pad carries
  planar walls + a cylindrical cap, so it is NOT a single elementary curved solid and the
  S5-a single-elementary-pair `ssi_boolean_solid` cannot drive it -- mirroring the curved-
  fillet slice is the robust path. Dispatched in `NativeEngine::wrap_emboss` for a native
  body (an OCCT body forwards to the Phase-3 oracle unconditionally), then the MANDATORY
  `wrapEmbossVerified` self-verify (watertight + volume GROWS by ~ `footprint area *
  height`; the wrapped footprint area equals the flat profile area because `px` is already
  arc-length) accepts it or discards -> OCCT; a native body the slice declines returns an
  HONEST ERROR (never forwarded -- OCCT would misread the native void). Gate 1 GREEN --
  host `test_native_wrap_emboss` (footprint/rectangle recovery + facet-soup watertightness
  + volume-growth + decline of deboss/non-rectangular/non-cylindrical). Gate 2 GREEN --
  `run-sim-native-wrap-emboss.sh` **6/6** through the `cc_*` facade under
  `cc_set_engine(1)` (`activeNative=1`), native pad-on-cylinder vs OCCT `cc_wrap_emboss`:
  vol rel <= 2.5e-3, area rel <= 7.3e-4, watertight, mesh-vol == B-rep, across
  `Rc in {10,8,12}`. Native-vs-OCCT gap is deflection-bounded (planar-facet tiling vs
  OCCT's exact cylindrical faces), well inside the 1% bar; nothing faked. STILL OCCT
  (NULL / honest error): DEBOSS (`boss=0`), NON-rectangular / >4-corner / dense /
  high-curvature profiles, NON-cylindrical (cone/sphere/planar/NURBS) base, footprints
  that wrap >2pi / self-overlap / run off the axial ends, non-positive height. Change

- â **#7 `native-exchange` â native STEP EXPORT slice DONE at BOTH gates (host +
  sim OCCT re-read round-trip); STEP import + IGES stay OCCT (honest end state, out
  of scope).** `cc_step_export` is NATIVE
  (engine-wired behind the same `cc_set_engine(1)` toggle) for a native-built solid
  whose every face surface + edge curve is in the writer's scope: it walks the
  native B-rep (src/native/topology) and emits a valid ISO-10303-21 STEP AP203 file
  in true MILLIMETRES â the HEADER (FILE_DESCRIPTION / FILE_NAME /
  FILE_SCHEMA 'CONFIG_CONTROL_DESIGN') + the Part-42 DATA graph (CARTESIAN_POINT /
  DIRECTION / AXIS2_PLACEMENT_3D, VERTEX_POINT, LINE / CIRCLE /
  B_SPLINE_CURVE_WITH_KNOTS + EDGE_CURVE, ORIENTED_EDGE â EDGE_LOOP,
  FACE_OUTER_BOUND / FACE_BOUND, PLANE / CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE / CONICAL_SURFACE /

  MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP, wrapped in ADVANCED_BREP_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION + the mm
  SI_UNIT geometric context + PRODUCT / PRODUCT_DEFINITION / APPLICATION_CONTEXT
  boilerplate). Built OCCT-FREE under `src/native/exchange/` (`step_writer.h/.cpp`,
  aggregate `native_exchange.h`, entry `step_export_native(solid, path)`) on the
  #1â#6 topology/math foundation. The native builders emit PER-FACE edges (edge-node
  sharing deferred, NATIVE-REWRITE.md #4), so the writer DEDUPLICATES geometrically â
  coincident vertices collapse to one VERTEX_POINT and the two faces meeting at a
  physical edge share ONE EDGE_CURVE (used forward on one face, reversed on the
  other via ORIENTED_EDGE) â producing a properly-sewn manifold CLOSED_SHELL that
  re-reads as a solid, not a heap of coincident faces. **Native-else-OCCT wiring
  (honest):** `NativeEngine::step_export` runs native for a native body IN SCOPE;
  a native body OUT of scope (an unsupported geometry kind) returns a clean error
  (never a native void handed to OCCT); a NON-native (OCCT-built) body forwards to
  `STEPControl_Writer`. **`cc_step_import` STAYS OCCT at export time** (parsing arbitrary STEP is
  the huge part; a first native IMPORT slice landed later â see the import bullet below) and **`cc_iges_export/import` STAY OCCT** â that is
  the honest end state (#8 drop-occt stays blocked on import + IGES + curved/general
  booleans). No cc_* ABI change; default engine stays OCCT. Entity arg orders were
  cross-checked against the OCCT `RWStep*` writer modules (EDGE_CURVE / ADVANCED_FACE
  / CIRCLE / LINE / VECTOR / ORIENTED_EDGE / B_SPLINE_CURVE_WITH_KNOTS all match) so
  the file parses through `STEPControl_Reader`. Gate 1 (host, no OCCT) GREEN â host
  `test_native_step_writer` (6 cases: canSerialize scope boundary; box â valid
  AP203 header + wrapper + mm SI_UNIT; box geometry 6 PLANE / 12 shared EDGE_CURVE /
  8 VERTEX_POINT; cylinder â CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE + CIRCLE rims; every DATA line a
  well-formed contiguous `#n = ENTITY(...);`; coordinates emitted as STEP REALs) +
  `test_native_engine::native_step_export_writes_valid_ap203_file` (the facade
  `cc_step_export` runs native on a native box, returns 1, writes a file with the
  ISO magic + MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP + mm SI_UNIT); host CTest **21/21**, all native
  suites green. All writer functions ð¢ Excellent (â¤ 7 cognitive complexity), no
  systems-band function. **Gate 2 (sim OCCT re-read parity) GREEN** â
  `tests/sim/native_step_parity.mm` + `scripts/run-sim-native-step.sh` through the
  `cc_*` facade: **`[NSTEP]` 28 passed / 0 failed** â each native STEP file re-reads
  through `STEPControl_Reader` to the SAME solid as its source (box EXACT vol 1000 /
  6 faces / 24 edges; cylinder vol rel 1.27e-3, 9 faces; holed-plate vol rel 2.90e-4,
  7 faces, valid), the native-written and OCCT-written files re-read to EQUIVALENT
  solids (writer-parity rel â¤ 4.7e-15), and a FOREIGN (OCCT-built) body forwards to
  `STEPControl_Writer` (fall-through, active native). **Two writer bugs fixed to reach
  this gate:** (1) EDGE_LOOP / ADVANCED_FACE emitted a stray extra empty string
  (`'',''`), giving EDGE_LOOP 3 args (schema 2) and ADVANCED_FACE 5 (schema 4) â OCCT
  rejected both and transferred an EMPTY solid (0 faces, vol 0); (2) a full-turn
  periodic wall (a cylindrical hole wall) was emitted as a periodic surface trimmed to
  its full period with NO seam edge, which OCCT reads back with zero wall area (a
  leaky, invalid solid) â the writer now synthesises the required SEAM edge (a straight
  LINE used forward at u=period and reversed at u=0, mirroring `STEPControl_Writer`'s
  cylindrical-hole-wall representation) for any Cylinder/Cone/Sphere face whose loop is
  closed full-circle rim edges. Both are pinned by host regression tests
  (`edge_loop_and_advanced_face_have_schema_arg_counts`,
  `cylindrical_hole_wall_emits_seam_edge`). The sewn re-read solid legitimately gains
  one seam edge per periodic wall the native deferred-edge-sharing source omits
  (native src 28 â re-read 30 for the holed plate, matching OCCT's own writer), which
  the harness edge-count check now accepts as a bounded superset. STILL OCCT at export time (never
  faked): STEP IMPORT (a native subset landed later, below), IGES import/export, and a
  native solid with an out-of-scope geometry kind (Ellipse/Bezier curve, rational
  spline, Bezier surface) â OCCT fallback for an OCCT body / honest error for a
  native void. Living change `add-native-data-exchange` **archived** (validate
  --strict green). This is the native EXPORT slice only â import + IGES stay OCCT by
  design.
- ✅ **#7/#3 `native-exchange` — FIRST native STEP IMPORT slice DONE at BOTH gates (host round-trip + sim OCCT parity); sits on the #4 healing slice.** Behind the existing `cc_step_import(path)` ABI (default engine still OCCT), `NativeEngine::step_import` now runs an OCCT-FREE ISO-10303-21 (Part 21) reader (`src/native/exchange/step_reader.{h,cpp}`, entry `step_import_native(path)` / `readStepString`) that tokenizes the DATA section into a `map<int,Record>` (integer refs `#N`, typed reals incl. `1.E2`, strings, enums `.T.`, nested lists, `$`) and runs a TWO-PASS mapper: leaf geometry (CARTESIAN_POINT / DIRECTION / AXIS2_PLACEMENT_3D, LINE / CIRCLE / B_SPLINE_CURVE_WITH_KNOTS, PLANE / CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE / CONICAL_SURFACE / SPHERICAL_SURFACE / B_SPLINE_SURFACE) then topology (VERTEX_POINT → EDGE_CURVE → ORIENTED_EDGE → EDGE_LOOP → FACE_OUTER_BOUND/FACE_BOUND → ADVANCED_FACE → CLOSED_SHELL → MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP), deduping shared EDGE_CURVE/VERTEX_POINT, building the B-rep through `topology::ShapeBuilder`, then running `heal::healShell` to close the sub-tolerance gaps STEP carries. It is the EXACT inverse of `step_writer.cpp` (writer untouched — additive). **Honest decline → OCCT (never fabricated):** unsupported surface/curve keyword (TOROIDAL / SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION / offset / trimmed / Bezier surface; ELLIPSE / TRIMMED_CURVE / Bezier / rational-weighted B-spline), assembly / >1 MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP, non-mm unit, malformed/dangling record, or any reconstruction failing the watertight+vol>0 self-verify → NULL, and the engine falls through to `STEPControl_Reader` (labelled). **Gate 1 (host, NO OCCT) GREEN** — `test_native_step_reader` 9/9: box round-trips EXACT (vol 1000, 6 faces / 8 verts / 12 edges, watertight), cylinder + holed-plate watertight with vol rel<1e-9 (host round-trip is byte-inverse of the writer, un-foolably native since no OCCT is linked), and 5 decline cases (TOROIDAL surface, 2-root assembly, non-mm unit, malformed string, empty) return NULL. Host CTest **29/29**. **Gate 2 (sim vs OCCT `STEPControl_Reader`) GREEN** — `tests/sim/native_step_import_parity.mm` + `scripts/run-sim-native-step-import.sh`: **`[NIMPORT]` 15 passed / 0 failed** — native-written box (vol rel 2.27e-16), cylinder (rel 1.27e-3), holed-plate (rel 2.90e-4) all watertight and matching the OCCT re-import within tol, AND FOREIGN OCCT-`STEPControl_Writer`-written box + cylinder imported NATIVELY match OCCT re-import EXACTLY (rel 0). The native path is provably exercised on gate 2(a): the reader reports per-face-oriented edge counts (box 24=2×12, cyl 30) whereas an OCCT fallback would report OCCT's unique count. **Honest residual / deferred to OCCT:** assemblies, AP242, complex/typed profiles beyond the writer's set, all IGES, and a B-spline-FACE solid round-trip (the reader maps B_SPLINE_SURFACE but no `cc_solid_*` builder emits a watertight bspline-face fixture, so no non-fabricated fixture exists yet — documented gap, not silently skipped). Change `add-native-step-import` archived (validate --strict green).
- ✅ **#4 `native-healing` — FIRST shape-healing slice DONE at BOTH gates (host + sim).** An INTERNAL, OCCT-FREE healer (`cybercad::native::heal::healShell`, `src/native/heal/*`) that stitches a face-soup / malformed shell into a connected, consistently-oriented, WATERTIGHT solid — or reports UNHEALED honestly. Four sub-operations, in dependency order: **vertex/tolerance unification** (the `boolean/assemble.h` `VertexPool` spatial hash generalized to arbitrary B-rep vertices), **tolerant sewing** (an edge becomes shared iff its endpoints unified to the same two shared vertices within tolerance — never a fabricated coincidence), **degenerate removal** (zero-length edges + sliver/near-zero-area faces via a min-height test), and **orientation fix** (flood-fill consistent winding across shared edges + a global enclosed-volume-sign tie-break). Every heal is SELF-VERIFIED (`tessellate::isWatertight` + `enclosedVolume > 0` across a deflection ladder) before it is kept; otherwise a typed `Unhealed` result carries the measured `maxResidualGap` and the ORIGINAL shape UNCHANGED. Gate 1 (host, no OCCT): `test_native_heal` — soup-cube heals to V=1 with `nMergedEdges=12` / `nMergedVerts=16`, a degenerate-edge and a sliver-face are dropped and the cube still heals to V=1, a flipped face is re-oriented (`nFlipped=1`), an all-inward cube triggers the global sign flip, near-coincident vertices unify (and beyond-tol ones never do), and both un-healable fixtures (missing face → `OpenShell`; gap 1e-2 → `GapBeyondTolerance`, residual 0.0255) report UNHEALED with the input unchanged — green under NUMSCI OFF **and** ON. Gate 2 (sim, `run-sim-native-heal.sh`): native-vs-OCCT parity on identical soups — `[NHEAL] 4 passed / 0 failed`: the in-scope soup-cube + flipped-face heal to V=1 matching OCCT `BRepBuilderAPI_Sewing` + `ShapeFix_Shell`/`ShapeFix_Solid` (V=1, valid), and on the beyond-tol / missing-face fixtures the native UNHEALED verdict MATCHES OCCT leaving the shell open (no valid closed solid at the same tolerance). The engine-internal `tryNativeHeal` (`src/engine/native/native_heal_hook.h`) wires native → self-verify → OCCT fallback (`src/engine/occt/occt_shapefix.cpp`); NO `cc_*` entry point, no ABI change, and `src/native/**` stays OCCT-free. **Honest scope (asymptotic, like SSI S4-f):** this slice heals the coincident-within-tolerance / degenerate / orientation defect family EXACTLY — it is a **measured win vs OCCT on the in-scope fixtures, not a guarantee** on arbitrary broken industrial B-rep. Beyond-tolerance gap bridging, missing-pcurve reconstruction, self-intersecting-wire repair, and freeform re-approximation stay OUT OF SCOPE — reported UNHEALED, deferred to OCCT `ShapeFix`, never faked. **Why this is the gating foundation for native STEP IMPORT (#3):** imported B-rep almost always arrives with coincident-within-tolerance shared edges/vertices that are NOT topologically shared, plus degenerate/orientation defects — exactly this healer's in-scope family — so a future native STEP reader can reconstruct topology through this slice and route only the residual (real gaps, missing pcurves, self-intersecting wires) to OCCT. Change `add-native-shape-healing` (7 ADDED requirements / 14 scenarios), archived to `openspec/specs/native-healing`.
- â #8 `drop-occt` â planned; **NOT reachable** at the current native ceiling. Two
  hard, research-grade multi-year dependencies remain: (1) a general robust curved
  boolean / blend kernel (arbitrary surface-surface intersection + shape healing) and
  (2) a FULL native STEP IMPORT (a full AP203/AP214/AP242 parser and B-rep
  reconstructor â the native reader today covers only the elementary/B-spline AP203
  subset; assemblies, AP242, and complex profiles still fall back to OCCT. IGES import/export are DESCOPED — STEP-only). Until BOTH exist, OCCT stays linked
  and Phase 4 stands COMPLETE AT ITS ACHIEVABLE NATIVE CEILING, not fully drop-OCCT.

## Remaining work to drop OCCT â ordered by difficulty (+ effort)

Critical path: **#2 numeric foundations (DONE) â #5 SSI (NEXT) â curved booleans â
#6 blends â #7 wrap-emboss**, with **#4 healing (FIRST NATIVE SLICE DONE at the bar) gating #3 import** as a parallel track.
Both gate **#8**. **#2 is done** â NumPP/SciPP adopted, generic solvers + native
closest-point verified vs OCCT `Extrema` â so the next critical-path item is **#5 SSI**: its **S1 analytic + S2 subdivision seeding are now DONE**
(S1: 17 elementary pairs closed-form + verified vs OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS`, `add-native-ssi-analytic`
archived; S2: transversal branch recall 1.00 on freeform/skew-quadric pairs, seeds on both
surfaces ≤ 3.51e-16, `add-native-ssi-seeding`), and what remains is
**S3 marching-line tracer (NEXT, consuming the S2 seeds)** → **S4 tangent-robustness (near-tangent
seed) layer** on top of the substrate (the moat NumPP/SciPP does not buy), feeding the S5
curved-boolean payoff. Total to genuinely drop OCCT â **10â20 py** (a small team, several years); matching
OCCT means re-earning its person-decades of hardening on real CAD data.

### Effort banked so far (human-expert-equivalent)

The native rewrite delivered the entire analytic/tractable surface, verified vs
OCCT: math, topology, watertight tessellation, construction (extrude/revolve/
holed+typed profiles/spline+torus/N-loft/planar+non-planar sweep/threads/shank),
planar + axis-aligned boxâ©cylinder booleans, planar blends, STEP export, and the
**numeric foundations (#2) â NumPP/SciPP adopted as the OCCT-free substrate + native
closest-point/projection verified vs OCCT `Extrema`**. Cumulative â **0.6â0.9 py** of
skilled kernel work, plus the ~**0.15â0.35 py** #2 slice bought largely by adopting
NumPP/SciPP rather than hand-writing the solver layer (a ~60â75% saving on #2).

- **Last batch (geometry-completion) gained â 3â5 person-weeks** â spline edges,
  torus revolve (+ native `Torus`), N-section loft, non-planar RMF sweep â and
  proved the boundary (declines/fallbacks correctly identified, not faked).
- It did **not** shorten the ~10â20 py drop-OCCT tail: that tail is the SSI +
  healing + import hard core, orthogonal to this construction work. By *effort*
  we are ~5â8% of the way to full drop-OCCT; by *tractable-capability breadth*,
  ~complete. The remaining 90%+ is the research-grade core.

Progress is reflected in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) Phase 4 and per-change
`tasks.md`; living specs are synced/archived per capability as they pass the
verification gates.
