// seed.h — result types for SSI Stage S2 (subdivision seeding).
//
// A `Seed` is one point on ONE distinct TRANSVERSAL intersection branch of two
// native surfaces, refined to lie on BOTH surfaces within tolerance, and carrying
// its parameters on both surfaces (u1,v1,u2,v2). A `SeedSet` is the deduped set of
// such seeds (≈ one per branch) plus the honest diagnostics the S2 contract
// requires — how many candidate regions the subdivision produced, and how many were
// dropped as near-tangent / degenerate (the reported S4 gap).
//
// `SeedSet` is the INPUT CONTRACT for S3 marching: the tracer walks one WLine per
// `Seed`, starting from its (u1,v1,u2,v2). `deferredTangent > 0` is a first-class,
// honest outcome (branches seen but not safely seeded → S4), not an error — the
// same "deferral-is-data" stance S1's NotAnalytic takes.
//
// This header is pure data + OCCT-free + SUBSTRATE-FREE: it does not include
// native-numerics, so it compiles even without CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI (the seeding
// ENTRY POINT that fills these structs is what is guarded). Uses src/native/math
// only. clang++ -std=c++20.
