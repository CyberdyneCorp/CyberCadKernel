# SSI → Curved Booleans — Implementation Sub-Roadmap

The keystone of the drop-OCCT endgame. **Surface-Surface Intersection (SSI)** is
the enabler; **general curved booleans** are the payoff (and blends + curved
wrap-emboss sit on top of them). This plan stages SSI analytic-first, each stage
verified native-vs-OCCT, with honest fallback — the same discipline every prior
native tier used.

Parent: [NATIVE-REWRITE.md](NATIVE-REWRITE.md) capability #5. Substrate eval:
[../docs/EVAL-numpp-scipp.md](../docs/EVAL-numpp-scipp.md).

## What we already have (the on-ramp — DONE)

- **Native geometry** — `src/native/math/` (plane/cylinder/cone/sphere/torus +
  Bézier/B-spline/NURBS curves & surfaces: point + dU/dV + normal).
- **Native topology + tessellation** — `src/native/{topology,tessellate}/`
  (watertight two-stage mesher, shared-edge weld).
- **Numeric substrate (#2, adopted)** — NumPP/SciPP behind
  `src/native/numerics/`: `fsolve` / `minimize`(BFGS) / `least_squares` /
  `solve` / `lstsq`, and **native closest-point / projection** (point→curve,
  point→surface) verified vs OCCT `Extrema`.
- **Boolean assembler** — `src/native/boolean/` BSP-CSG (planar polyhedra, exact)
  + the axis-aligned box∩cylinder analytic curved slice. This is what S5 extends.

## What the substrate does NOT buy (the moat — from the eval)

- Local Newton/LM **re-projection** onto both surfaces: ✅ provided (converges 1e-14…1e-6).
- **Finding** intersection points from a naive seed: ✗ (generic `fsolve` 0/7 on freeform).
- **Near-tangent / coincident** robustness: ✗ (both Newton and damped-LM break).

So the work is exactly: **seeding + marching + tangent/degeneracy robustness**,
built on the substrate. That is S2–S4 below.

## Verification model (every stage)

Two gates, as always: **host analytic** (intersection matches closed-form / all
sampled points lie on both surfaces within tol; no OCCT) + **sim native-vs-OCCT**
(vs `Geom`/`GeomAPI_IntSS` / `IntPatch` for curves; vs `BRepAlgoAPI` for the S5
boolean payoff — volume/watertight). Mandatory **self-verify → OCCT fallback**:
never emit a wrong/leaky curved result. Oracle source: `/Users/leonardoaraujo/work/OCCT/src`
(`IntPatch` Imp/Imp·Imp/Prm·Prm/Prm, `IntWalk`, `ALine`/`WLine`).

## Stages (dependency order, analytic-first)

### S1 — Analytic SSI (elementary-surface pairs) · ✅ DONE AT THE BAR
Closed-form intersection curves for elementary pairs: plane∩plane (line),
plane∩{cylinder,cone,sphere,torus} (line/conic/circle), coaxial/parallel
cylinder∩cylinder, coaxial sphere/cylinder/cone families, sphere∩sphere (circle).
**No marching** — pure closed-form math over `native-math` (generalizes the
plane∩cylinder we already shipped). Returns exact `Line`/`Circle`/`Ellipse`/
`Parabola`/`Hyperbola` `Geom`-quality curves. OCCT-free, header-only under
`src/native/ssi/`; INTERNAL (no `cc_*` entry point — parity asserted at the C++
boundary like native-math). Change `add-native-ssi-analytic` (**archived**).
- **Verify:** ✅ host analytic `test_native_ssi` (**11 cases, 0 failed**) + ✅ sim
  native-vs-OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` parity `run-sim-native-ssi.sh` (**18 pairs, 0
  failed**). No regressions (`run-sim-suite.sh` **221/221**).
- **Unlocks:** most CAD-primitive curved booleans (S5 restricted to elementary faces).

**Analytic-native pairs, native-vs-OCCT deltas** (onSurf = max residual of native
curve samples on both input surfaces; coin = native-vs-OCCT curve coincidence; all
at machine epsilon, well inside each pair's tol):

| Pair | native | OCCT | kind | onSurf | coin | tol |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| plane ∩ plane | 1 | 1 | Line | 0 | 0 | 1e-9 |
| plane ∩ sphere | 1 | 1 | Circle | 3.79e-15 | 3.82e-15 | 1e-9 |
| plane ⟂ cyl | 1 | 1 | Circle | 1.91e-15 | 1.91e-15 | 1e-9 |
| plane ∠ cyl | 1 | 1 | Ellipse | 1.42e-15 | 2.57e-15 | 1e-8 |
| plane ∥ cyl | 2 | 2 | Line/Line | 5.55e-17 | 0 | 1e-9 |
| plane ⟂ cone | 1 | 1 | Circle | 3.59e-15 | 3.59e-15 | 1e-7 |
| plane ∠ cone | 1 | 1 | Ellipse | 2.44e-15 | 5.37e-15 | 1e-6 |
| plane ∥ gen cone | 1 | 1 | Parabola | 2.03e-15 | 9.74e-16 | 1e-6 |
| plane steep cone | 2 | 2 | Hyperbola×2 | 5.61e-16 | 4.45e-16 | 1e-6 |
| plane ⟂ torus | 2 | 2 | Circle/Circle | 2.84e-15 | 2.84e-15 | 1e-9 |
| plane ∋ axis torus | 2 | 2 | Circle/Circle | 9.93e-16 | 1.67e-15 | 1e-8 |
| sphere ∩ sphere | 1 | 2 | Circle (OCCT arc-splits) | 4.12e-15 | 3.82e-15 | 1e-9 |
| coaxial sphere ∩ cyl | 2 | 2 | Circle/Circle | 1.88e-15 | 2.39e-15 | 1e-9 |
| coaxial sphere ∩ cone | 2 | 3 | Circle/Circle (OCCT arc-split) | 3.14e-15 | 2.78e-15 | 1e-7 |
| coaxial cyl ∩ cone | 2 | 3 | Circle/Circle (OCCT arc-split) | 1.79e-15 | 1.52e-15 | 1e-7 |
| parallel cyl ∩ cyl | 2 | 2 | Line/Line | 1.26e-15 | 0 | 1e-9 |
| coaxial cyl ∩ cyl | 0 | 0 | coincident (detected) | 0 | 0 | 1e-9 |

Curve-count deltas (sphere∩sphere, coaxial sphere∩cone/cyl, coaxial cyl∩cone) are
OCCT arc-splitting the SAME conic — curve TYPES match on every analytic pair.

**Deferred at S1 (honest `NotAnalytic`, verified — not faked):** **skew cyl∩cyl**
(native `NotAnalytic`; OCCT emits 7 Ellipse curves — general skew cyl/cyl is a
planar quartic, no degree-≤2 closed-form reduction), and by the same rule general
cone∩cone, non-coaxial cone∩cyl / sphere∩cyl / sphere∩cone, oblique plane∩torus
(spiric quartic), torus∩curved, and all freeform pairs. These route to S2/S3 below.

### S2 — Subdivision seeding · ✅ DONE AT THE BAR (transversal)
Find ≥1 seed point per **transversal** intersection branch for the **freeform**
(NURBS/Bézier/B-spline) and **non-closed-form quadric** pairs S1 defers: recursive
patch-AABB-overlap subdivision → candidate regions → refine to a point with
`least_squares(S1(u1,v1) − S2(u2,v2) = 0)` (substrate) → 3D/param dedup to ~one seed
per branch. Native, OCCT-free (`cybercad::native::ssi`), refine under
`CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`; INTERNAL (no `cc_*`). Change `add-native-ssi-seeding`.
- **Module:** `src/native/ssi/{seed.h,patch_bounds.h,seeding.h,seeding.cpp}`.
  Per-patch AABB = **control-net convex hull ∩ sampled-with-Lipschitz-margin** for
  freeform (both sound; the sampled bound guarantees the box shrinks under
  subdivision even for a single-span Bézier whose hull does not), **sampled+margin**
  for elementary+torus. Dedup is **topological** (union candidate regions adjacent in
  parameter space on both surfaces, periodic-seam aware) — scale-free and immune to
  the along-branch metric-gap problem — and clusters BEFORE the refine so
  `least_squares` runs ≈ once per branch, not per candidate.
- **Verify:** ✅ host `test_native_ssi_seeding` (**6 cases, 0 failed** — skew cyl→2,
  crossing spheres→1, sphere∩Bézier-bump→1, parallel planes→0, **tangent spheres →
  `deferredTangent`, no faked seed**, deeper resolution recovers a small loop; NUMSCI
  OFF CTest **23/23** with the NUMSCI-gated tests correctly ABSENT, NUMSCI ON CTest
  **25/25**) + ✅ sim native-vs-OCCT recall `native_ssi_seeding_recall.mm` (**3 pairs,
  recall 1.00**, tangent = 0 everywhere, max per-seed on-both-surfaces residual
  **3.51e-16** via `GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnSurf::LowerDistance`, well under the 1e-6
  `onSurfTol`; OCCT arc-splits the same loci — NbLines 3/2/2 ≥ native branch count 2/1/1,
  exactly as at S1). No regressions (`run-sim-suite.sh` **221/221**, xcframework rebuilt
  with `seeding.cpp`).
- **Honest scope / risk:** TRANSVERSAL only. **Near-tangent / coincident / degenerate**
  seeding ill-conditions the refine → **deferred to S4** (counted in
  `SeedSet.deferredTangent`, reported not faked). Completeness is a **measured recall**
  figure, not a blind 100%: too-shallow subdivision can miss a small loop (the
  acknowledged failure mode); `minPatchFrac` (default 1/32) is the resolution/recall
  knob — deeper recovers smaller loops at more cost.
- **Unlocks:** S3 marching — the `SeedSet` is its input contract (one WLine per seed).

### S3 — Marching-line tracer (WLine) · ✅ DONE AT THE BAR (transversal)
From each seed, walk the intersection curve: tangent = normalize(n₁×n₂), adaptive
step, **re-project** onto both surfaces via the substrate (Newton/LM), until the
curve closes or exits a boundary; fit a B-spline through the polyline. This is
OCCT's `IntWalk`/`WLine`, on our substrate. Native, OCCT-free
(`cybercad::native::ssi`); corrector / adaptive step / B-spline fit under
`CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` (empty TU with NUMSCI off); INTERNAL (no `cc_*`). Consumes the
S2 `SeedSet`, produces one `WLine` per transversal branch (`Closed`/`BoundaryExit`)
+ a `TraceSet` for S5. Change `add-native-ssi-marching` (**archived**).
- **Module:** `src/native/ssi/{marching.h,marching.cpp}` (result types + tracer in one
  OCCT-free header; `native_ssi.h` includes it).
- **Verify:** ✅ host known-shape `test_native_ssi_marching` (**7 cases, 0 failed** —
  crossing spheres / plane∩sphere / skew-cyl loops / sphere∩Bézier bump → Closed;
  ramp B-spline∩plane → BoundaryExit open segment; tangent spheres → no curve
  (deferred, not faked); duplicate seed → 1 WLine; every node on both surfaces < 1e-6,
  fit error < 1e-3; NUMSCI OFF CTest **23/23** S3 tests correctly ABSENT, NUMSCI ON
  CTest **26/26**) + ✅ sim native-vs-OCCT curve parity `native_ssi_marching_parity.mm`
  (**5 pairs, 9 branches, 0 failed**; `IntPatch`/`GeomAPI_IntSS` oracle). No regressions
  (`run-sim-suite.sh` **221/221**).

**Marching-native pairs, native-vs-OCCT deltas** (all transversal, all FULLY TRACED,
0 near-tangent-truncated → deferred to S4; onCurve = max native-sample distance to the
OCCT curve, onSurf = max residual on both input surfaces, lenΔ = |nat−occt| arc length):

| Pair | branches nat/occt | closed | onCurve | onSurf | lenΔ (nat / occt) | nt | seeds |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| bspline ∩ bspline | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1.86e-07 | 2.71e-08 | 4.35e-06 (2.8171 / 2.8171) | 0 | 1 |
| bspline ∩ plane | 4/4 | 0/0 | 5.75e-09 | 1.41e-11 | 2.28e-03 (0.6917 / 0.6933) | 0 | 4 |
| skew cyl unequal | 2/2 | 2/2 | 1.60e-06 | 6.81e-07 | 4.00e-05 (9.1521 / 9.1525) | 0 | 2 |
| sphere ∩ sphere | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1.43e-07 | 1.23e-07 | 1.58e-05 (5.4413 / 5.4414) | 0 | 1 |
| sphere ∩ bezier | 1/1 | 1/1 | 1.25e-07 | 3.37e-08 | 8.31e-05 (2.3696 / 2.3698) | 0 | 1 |

Aggregate: **9 branches / 5 pairs, all TRANSVERSAL fully-traced, 0 near-tangent-truncated**.
Closed-loop match **5/5** OCCT closed loops reproduced as Closed native WLines (bspline∩plane
correctly 0-closed / 4-open). Worst: max onCurve **1.60e-06**, max onSurf **6.81e-07** (both
skew-cyl-unequal); max lenΔ **2.28e-03** abs / ~0.33% rel (bspline∩plane — the only sub-mm-order
gap, within the deflection/step tol).

- **Honest scope / risk:** TRANSVERSAL only. **Near-tangent** branches are traced *up to*
  the tangent, marked `NearTangent`, counted in `nearTangentGaps` — never a point past it;
  **coincident / branch-point / self-intersection** deferred to S4. `nearTangentGaps > 0` is
  the honest S4 hand-off signal. Automatic densify-and-refit on a too-loose B-spline fit is
  not yet wired (the polyline stays the on-surface ground truth; the fit is a convenience
  curve) — follow-up.
- **Unlocks:** S5 curved booleans — the `TraceSet` (WLines with (u1,v1,u2,v2) per node) is
  its input contract.

### S4 — Tangent / degeneracy robustness · ◐ CLASSIFICATION LAYER (S4-a/b) + MARCHING-CORE SLICES (S4-c graze, S4-d branch points, S4-e sphere-pole/cone-apex chart singularities, S4-f robust closure + self-intersection guard + completeness critic) DONE AT THE BAR; S4-d/e general/freeform + S4-f general topology repair pending
Near-tangent stepping (n₁×n₂→0: step control, higher-order predictor),
coincident/overlapping-surface detection, branch points & singularities,
self-intersection guards. **This is the moat** — OCCT's decades of tuning. Lands
as *progressively hardened*; whatever isn't robust **falls back to OCCT** and is
reported with the measured gap. Never "done"; hardened over time. Broken into
tractable sub-slices; the **detection + classification** layer (S4-a/b) landed
first, ahead of the hard **marching core** (S4-c).

#### S4-a — Coincident / overlapping-surface detection + typed region · ✅ DONE AT THE BAR
Robust coincidence detection on BOTH the analytic path and the seeded path, plus a
**typed `CoincidentRegion`** (`FullSurfaceSame` for a same-locus pair;
`OverlapSubRegion` with param bounds for a partial overlap; `Undecided` → OCCT when
the region cannot be robustly delimited) so downstream queries/booleans consume a
region descriptor instead of a bare flag. Analytic: closed-form `FullSurfaceSame`
predicates for ALL elementary families (plane, coaxial-equal cyl/cone, same sphere,
same torus), folding the pre-existing same-sphere / coaxial-equal-cyl `Coincident`.
Seeded (`CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`): grid-sample a candidate region (agree iff on-both
residual ≤ `onSurfTol` AND ‖n_A×n_B‖ ≤ `tangentSinTol`), grow to the agreement
boundary, emit `OverlapSubRegion` and suppress seeds/march inside — or `Undecided`
on a fuzzy boundary. `src/native/ssi/{coincidence.h,same_surface.h}`, OCCT-free.

#### S4-b — Tangent-contact CLASSIFICATION · ✅ DONE AT THE BAR
Replaces the blunt `SeedSet.deferredTangent` counter with a **typed
`TangentContact`**: `TransversalOnly` (no tangency), `TangentPoint` (isolated 0-dim
contact — e.g. spheres at d=R₁+R₂; emits the point), `TangentCurve` (tangency along
a whole curve — e.g. cylinder tangent to a plane along a line, coaxial sphere∩cyl
equator; emits the curve), `NearTangentTransversal` (grazes but crosses — the S4-c
gap, classified and handed on, **never traced**), or `Undecided` → OCCT. Analytic
tangent configs decided in closed form (`tangent_analytic.h`); seeded solutions
classified by local differential geometry — the relative second fundamental form
`H = II_A − II_B` in the shared tangent basis: sign-definite → `TangentPoint`,
rank-1 → `TangentCurve`, indefinite → `NearTangentTransversal`, within the
model-scale curvature-noise band → `Undecided` (never hand-tuned to force a verdict).
`src/native/ssi/{tangent_contact.h,tangent_seeded.h}`; marching (`marching.h` `WLine`)
carries an additive typed `stopReason` at a `NearTangent` stop — the tracer still
**stops at** the tangency, it does **not** step through (that is S4-c). Change
`add-native-ssi-s4-classification` (**archived** `2026-07-04`).
- **Verify:** ✅ host `test_native_ssi_s4_classification` (**14 analytic + 8 seeded
  cases, 0 failed**; NUMSCI OFF CTest **26/26** with the 8 seeded cases correctly
  ABSENT, NUMSCI ON CTest **31/31**) + ✅ sim native-vs-OCCT classification parity
  `run-sim-native-ssi-s4.sh` (**8 pairs, 0 failed, 0 deferred**; oracle
  `IntAna_QuadQuadGeo` / `IntAna_ResultType` for analytic, `IntPatch` /
  `GeomAPI_IntSS` + `GeomLProp_SLProps` for seeded). No regressions
  (`run-sim-suite.sh` **221/221**, all six pre-S4 parity scripts still green,
  S5 `native-pass=5` persists).

**S4-a/b classification pairs, native-vs-OCCT** (worstOnSurf = max residual of the
emitted point/curve on both surfaces; all at machine epsilon):

| Pair | native | OCCT | worstOnSurf |
|---|---|---|---|
| same sphere | Same (`FullSurfaceSame`) | Same | 0 |
| spheres d=R₁+R₂ | TangentPoint | Point | 1.22e-16 |
| spheres crossing | Transversal | proper section | 0 |
| plane tangent sphere | TangentPoint | Point | 6.12e-17 |
| coaxial sphere∩cyl equator | TangentCurve (Circle) | tangent Circle | 1.84e-16 |
| plane tangent cyl | TangentCurve (Line) | tangent Line | 0 |
| seeded sph∩sph (diff-geom) | TangentPoint | Point (sine 1.22e-16) | 1.22e-16 |
| seeded sph∩cyl (diff-geom) | TangentCurve | Circle (sine 0) | 0 |

Honestly **deferred / undecided** (asserted as such in the host seeded suite, NOT
weakened, NOT fabricated): opposite-saddle patch pair → `NearTangentTransversal`
(indefinite relative II — the S4-c gap, handed on, never traced);
matched-curvature contact below the model-scale curvature-noise floor → `Undecided`
→ OCCT. The sim parity set was **0 deferred** — every pair was decidable and agreed
with OCCT.
- **Honest scope / risk:** DETECTION + CLASSIFICATION only. S4-a/b **type** the
  degeneracy and emit the point/curve/region where determinable; they do **not**
  march through a tangency and do **not** fabricate a curve across a degeneracy —
  that is S4-c. A `NearTangentTransversal` is classified and handed on (still an
  S4-c → OCCT gap), never traced. `Undecided`/`None`/empty on every non-robust
  classification → engine-owned OCCT fallback + self-verify.
- **Unlocks:** S5 curved booleans can consume `CoincidentRegion` / `TangentCurve`
  (overlap handling, tangent-seam trimming) — a later S5 slice; and the marching
  core (S4-c) has a typed reason feeding it.

#### S4-c — Marching THROUGH a tangency · ◐ FIRST HONEST SLICE DONE AT THE BAR (grazing-but-continuous curves); deeper bands + branch crossings remain
The hard core of the moat: MARCH THROUGH a near-tangency **when the curve genuinely
continues**, rather than truncating. The first slice (`add-native-ssi-s4c-near-tangent-marching`,
gated `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, additive to `marching.cpp`) crosses a **NearTangentTransversal
single-branch graze** with four levers:
- **Fixed-plane-cut corrector** — the S3 corrector's along-`t` advance residual `r₃ =
  dot(A.point−Pprev, t) − h` ill-conditions as `t = normalize(nA×nB)` degenerates
  (`sine → 0`). Inside the crossing band `t` is replaced by the **last-good FORWARD
  tangent `t★`**, a hyperplane the curve crosses transversally even where the local
  surface tangent degenerates, so the `least_squares` solve stays well-posed.
- **Curvature-aware predictor** — bends `P + h·t★` by the discrete curvature of the last
  two nodes so the corrector starts in-basin across the sharp bend.
- **Step control** — enters the band at `sine < tangentSinTol`, steps FINELY (capped at
  `h₀/16`, deflection-bounded) so it RESOLVES the region instead of leaping it, exits once
  `sine ≥ 1.5·tangentSinTol` on the far side; `crossMaxSteps` budget + `minStep` floor.
- **Crossable gate (the honesty core)** — crosses ONLY when S4-b
  `classify_tangent_contact_seeded` types the stall `NearTangentTransversal` AND it is a
  genuine single-branch graze. Two witnesses force a defer: a **steep sine collapse**
  (stall sine < ¼ of the last-good sine ⇒ a tangency/branch drives `sine → 0`) and a
  **band-minimum floor** (a fine look-ahead scan whose minimum sine drops below
  `0.3·tangentSinTol`). A **branch crossing** (the equal-cylinder saddle — two branches
  meet, S4-d), a `TangentPoint`/`TangentCurve`/`Undecided`, non-convergence at `minStep`,
  or any node failing the on-both-surfaces / monotone-advance verification ⇒ the arc is
  **discarded** and the march still STOPS + classifies + defers → OCCT. No point is ever
  fabricated past a degeneracy; a crossed arc is emitted only if every node verified on
  both surfaces ≤ `onSurfTol`. Crossed grazes are counted in
  `TraceSet.nearTangentCrossed`; `nearTangentGaps` now counts only the regions that could
  NOT be crossed.

**At the bar (host + sim, `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` ON):** a sphere grazed by an offset
cylinder that S3 TRUNCATES at `tangentSinTol=0.25` (sine dip ≈ 0.10) now traces the FULL
closed loop (`nearTangentGaps → 0`, `nearTangentCrossed ≥ 1`, every node on both surfaces
≤ 1e-6, crossed arc on the OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` locus ≤ 5e-4); the equal-radius
orthogonal cylinder **saddle (a branch crossing) STILL DEFERS with the flag off / at the
S4-c bar** (`nearTangentCrossed = 0`, `nearTangentGaps ≥ 1`) — that saddle is the S4-d
branch-point case, now localized + routed (below); genuine `TangentPoint`/`TangentCurve`
contacts still defer. Every S3 transversal fixture traces bit-identically (the
corrector/step outside the band is unchanged). Deeper near-coincident bands, general/freeform
+ higher-order-cusp singularities (S4-e tail; the sphere-pole/cone-apex chart singularities
are now crossed — see S4-e below) and self-intersection (S4-f) remain the tail: anything not
robustly crossable is still an honest `NearTangent` gap deferred to OCCT.

**S4-c deep-graze residual — RE-MEASURED, HONEST-DECLINE (freeform fuzzer, 3 seeds, N=48,
`0x5515D1FF0F0F`+2).** A pass targeting the "deeper near-tangent graze band the S4-c corrector
truncates" was investigated and DECLINED because the target does not exist in the current
measured build. Freeform fuzzer aggregate: **AGREED 124/144 (86.1%), HONESTLY-DECLINED 20/144
(13.9%), DISAGREED 0**. The decline reason histogram is **near-tangent 0, multi-branch 14,
small-loop 6** — the near-tangent MARCHING family is EMPTY. Per-decline anatomy (a diagnostic
probe over the marcher's `TraceSet`):
- **Every multi-branch decline is `seeded == traced`, `dedupedRetraces == 0`** — the recurring
  signature is `seeded=1 traced=1 deduped=0 occtComp=2`: S2 handed the marcher ONE seed, the
  marcher traced it perfectly (`BoundaryExit`, every node on both surfaces ≤ `onSurfTol`, node-on-
  OCCT-locus ≈ 5e-8), and OCCT found a SECOND distinct co-resident locus (`worstMissLen ≈ 2–5`,
  `genuineOcctOnNat ≈ 1.0–2.0`) the marcher was **never seeded for**. `deduped=0` proves the
  marcher did NOT drop a distinct loop — there was no second seed to drop. This is a pure **S2
  seeding-recall gap** (the subdivision seeder emits one seed for a twice-piercing pose), NOT a
  marching truncation. The completeness critic (finer subdivision + targeted uncovered-cell
  re-seed, loop-until-dry) recovers **zero** here (`criticRecoveredLoops == 0` at the finest
  floor) — the missed loci are co-resident in a way the AABB prune cannot separate, a seeding
  frontier, not a marcher lever.
- **Every small-loop decline is a fully-traced `Closed`/`BoundaryExit` with `nearTangentCrossed
  == 0`** whose native arc length matches the OCCT locus length (e.g. `arc=3.99` vs
  `occtTotLen=3.94`; `arc=0.203` vs `0.203`; `arc=5.67` vs `5.59`) with node-on-locus ≈ 5e-8.
  The 1.5e-3–4.6e-3 reverse-coverage miss (just over the fixed 1e-3 `onCurve` gate) is a
  **fitted-B-spline discretization bow** on a high-curvature loop — a fit-density artifact the
  harness already documents (`onCurve` comment: "a fitted-B-spline bow between nodes rides
  ~1e-4"), NOT a near-tangency the marcher truncated (`ntCross=0` confirms no crossing band was
  ever entered). S3 already traces these near-tangent loops fully and transversally.

**Conclusion / precise wall:** the S4 marching residual on the freeform fuzzer is **not a
near-tangent graze the marcher truncates** — the near-tangent marching family measures **0**.
The genuine ~14% decline is (a) **S2 seeding-recall of distinct co-resident loci** (dominant,
out of the marching scope and unrecovered by the completeness critic), and (b) a sub-`onCurve`
**fitted-spline coverage bow** on tight loops that ARE fully traced. No marching change to
`marching.{h,cpp}` can lower this decline without fabricating a curve across a locus that has no
seed, or re-baselining the `onCurve` fit gate — both refused. `DISAGREED == 0` holds; the
marcher's emitted geometry is correct on every node. The moat's next honest frontier is
**S2 seeding recall for co-resident branches**, not deeper S4-c graze marching.

**S2 CO-RESIDENT SEEDING-RECALL — FIXED + RE-MEASURED (freeform fuzzer, 3 seeds, N=48,
`0x5515D1FF0F0F`+2).** The frontier above was diagnosed and closed at the S2 layer (seeding.cpp
only; src/native stays OCCT-free; cc_* ABI byte-unchanged). Diagnosis (env-gated `CYBERCAD_SSI_SEED_DIAG`
per-cluster dump + host replay of the exact fuzz poses): on the `seeded=1 traced=1 deduped=0 occtComp=2`
cases, ALL candidate leaves of BOTH co-resident loci land in ONE param-adjacency cluster; the
distinct-locus split (`splitDistinctBranches`) then failed to separate them for a mechanical reason —
the per-cluster accumulator FIFO-appended refined seeds until a **flat 256 cap**, and one dense
locus tiles thousands of leaves that filled the cap in candidate-iteration order, **STARVING** the
co-resident locus's later leaves before the single-linkage split ever saw them (a second observed
sub-mode: `clusters=2` where one cluster's cells refine-missed). The fix (seeding.cpp): keep the
**FULL refined-seed density** per cluster (a thinned reservoir was tried and REJECTED — it left arc
gaps that spuriously split a SINGLE loop, breaking `march_bspline_bspline_closed_loop`), and make
the single-linkage split **O(m) via a uniform 3D spatial grid hash** so full density is affordable
(the old O(m²) linkage was what forced the small starving cap). The 256 cap becomes a pure safety
ceiling (65536) with no per-locus bias. HONEST/DISAGREED-safe: every retained seed is still a real
refined on-both-surfaces transversal crossing (`refineRegion` already gates point-on-both ≤ tol and
‖n₁×n₂‖ ≥ tangentSinTol); density only changes WHICH real seeds reach the split — never fabricates
a locus. **Measured before → after: AGREED 124→130/144 (86.1%→90.3%), HONESTLY-DECLINED 20→14
(13.9%→9.7%), multi-branch declines 14→9, DISAGREED 0→0 (bar holds).** Every recovered case became
AGREED (not DISAGREED), so the new seeds trace to curves on BOTH input surfaces AND on the OCCT
locus — genuineness confirmed by the oracle. Regression fixture: `seed_freeform_two_coresident_loci_recovered`
(the verbatim fuzz pose seed `0x5715d1ff1275` case 17 — two rational-NURBS∩B-spline loci; old S2
emitted 1 seed, new emits 2, each on both surfaces ≤ 1e-7 and transversal). Residual tail (9
declines): the remaining multi-branch cases are near-tangent-family poses where a co-resident locus
is itself near-tangent (a SEEDING-tangency deferral, honest → OCCT) or the `genuineOcctOnNat` miss
is a sub-`onCurve` fitted-spline bow (≈ 1.1e-3, just over the fixed 1e-3 gate) — the documented
fit-density artifact, not a fabrication.

#### S4-d — Branch points · ◐ TWO HONEST SLICES DONE AT THE BAR (analytic Steinmetz self-crossing + FIRST FREEFORM branch point: a B-spline saddle ∩ plane OPEN-ARM X-crossing; general multi-line/cusp/saddle∩saddle branches remain)
The hardest SSI piece: where the intersection **locus itself crosses** (multiple curve arms
meet at one point), LOCALIZE the branch point, ENUMERATE the outgoing arms from the local
second-order structure, ROUTE each arm with the S3 marcher, then ASSEMBLE the multi-arm
curve. The first slice (`add-native-ssi-s4d-branch-points`, archived `2026-07-04`, gated
`CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, additive to `marching.cpp` + new `branch_point.h`, default-on
`enableBranchPoints`) fires **exactly where S4-c would have deferred** (the steep-sine-
collapse + tangent-flip witness) and resolves the elementary **transversal self-crossing**:
- **Localize** — `nn::minimize` the transversality sine `g(s) = ‖n_A×n_B‖` along the
  bracketed approach (each trial re-projected onto both surfaces with the S4-c fixed-plane
  corrector), then a full `nn::least_squares` re-project of the minimum onto both surfaces;
  accepted only when `‖A−B‖ ≤ onSurfTol` and the sine is at/near the floor, else DEFER
  (no fabricated B).
- **Enumerate arms** — build the shared tangent-plane basis at B, form the relative second
  fundamental form `H = II_A − II_B`, and solve the tangent-cone quadratic. Discriminant
  `Δ > 0` ⇒ two distinct real tangent lines ⇒ up to four world-space rays (`±T₁, ±T₂`);
  `Δ ≤ 0` ⇒ EMPTY (definite ⇒ isolated `TangentPoint`, END; double root ⇒ cusp, out of
  scope, DEFER). **Never fabricates a ray** — the same discriminant sign as S4-b's
  `TangentPoint` classification enforces "an isolated tangent point still ends".
- **Route + assemble** — step `h₀/8` off B along each real ray, S4-c-correct back onto both
  surfaces, then run the normal S3 walk to termination; dedup arms that retrace a kept arm
  (`retraces`) and merge their shared branch-point connectivity into the `BranchNode`; count
  `TraceSet.branchPoints` and record `armLineIds`. A branch not robustly
  localizable/enumerable/routable STOPS + defers **exactly as S4-c** (a `NearTangent` WLine
  counted in `nearTangentGaps`).

**At the bar (host + sim, `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` ON):** the **Steinmetz bicylinder** (two
equal-radius R=1 cylinders, axes Z and X crossing orthogonally) — which S3+S4-c TRUNCATE at
the saddle (one `NearTangent` WLine, `branchPoints = 0`) — is now **FULLY traced**: both
branch points localized at `(0, ±1, 0)` (branch sine ≈ 5e-8 / 9e-8, re-projection residual
≈ 5e-13), four `BranchArc` arms routed and assembled into the two crossing ellipses,
`nearTangentGaps = 0`, every node on both cylinders ≤ `onSurfTol`. Sim parity vs OCCT
`IntPatch`/`GeomAPI_IntSS`: `eq-cyl s4d branchPts=2 traced=4 arms=3 onCurve=1.74e-6
onSurf=1.07e-8` — every native arc node on the OCCT locus and on both surfaces, both branch
points matching the OCCT saddles at `(0, ±1, 0)` to tol. The isolated `TangentPoint` (two
spheres at `d = R₁+R₂`) STILL ENDS with zero arms (definite `H` ⇒ no real roots); the S4-c
graze still crosses (`crossed = 22`); the flag-off eq-cyl control still defers; the 5
transversal pairs stay `nt = 0` bit-identical.

**Second slice — FIRST FREEFORM branch point (M1, `moat-m1-ssi-s4-general`, gated
`CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, additive to `marching.{h,cpp}` only — no change to `branch_point.h`).**
The S4-d machinery (`localize` / `enumerateArms` / `sharedTangentFrame` / `relativeSecondForm` /
`solveTangentCone` / `routeArm` / `routeBranches`) is SURFACE-AGNOSTIC — it touches a surface only
through `SurfaceAdapter` — so a **bicubic B-spline saddle tangent to a plane through its saddle
point** localizes `branchPoints == 1` on both surfaces ≤ `onSurfTol` and enumerates the correct FOUR
arm rays with the EXISTING code. The ONE gap was ASSEMBLY, not geometry: the Steinmetz branch is a
CLOSED network (each arc runs branch-to-branch, so `reclassifyBranchArcs` recognised only
both-ends-on-a-branch), but a freeform X-crossing on a FINITE patch radiates FOUR **OPEN** arms
(each branch-to-boundary — one end the localized branch, the other a clean domain exit). Fix (the
whole slice): two additive `WLine` flags `frontNearTangent` / `backNearTangent` record WHICH end
stalled at a near-tangency, and `reclassifyBranchArcs` is generalised to the honest OPEN-ARM rule —
reclassify to `BranchArc` iff every END that stalled sits on a localized branch point and at least
one does; a near-tangent end NOT on a branch keeps the arc a `nearTangentGaps` gap (defer → OCCT).
This reduces EXACTLY to the both-ends rule for Steinmetz (bit-identical). At the bar (host + sim):
`saddle s4d-g branchPts=1 NTgaps=0 traced=4 arms=3 onCurve=8.93e-8 onSurf=5.10e-10 occtBr=4` — every
arm node on the OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` locus and on both surfaces, the branch at the saddle. The
honesty control (a B-spline BUMP `z=0.15·(x²+y²)` tangent to a plane, definite `H`, Δ ≤ 0) still ENDS
with NO arms (`branchPoints == 0`, never a fabricated arm); the not-through-saddle (`z=0`) plane
still traces two DISJOINT open curves with `branchPoints == 0`. NOTE: the once-hypothesised
Richardson third-derivative bias-cancellation was REFUTED (the central-difference `relativeSecondForm`
already cancels odd-order terms, κ at B is O(δ²)-accurate ~1e-7) and is NOT shipped — no dead code.

- **Honest scope / risk:** the **elementary two-real-distinct-line transversal self-crossing** is
  now traced for BOTH the analytic Steinmetz family (closed network) AND the first FREEFORM case (a
  B-spline saddle ∩ plane, open arms). Still DEFERRED → OCCT, reported with the measured gap, never
  faked: **non-transversal (definite) freeform contacts** (end with no arms — pinned by the bump
  control), **freeform cusps** (double root of the tangent-cone quadratic), **higher-multiplicity
  junctions** (three-plus tangent lines at one point), **both-operand-freeform saddle∩saddle** whose
  branch does not verify, and **general small-loop / topology repair (the S4-f residual)**. (**S4-e
  chart singularities** — the sphere parametric pole + cone apex — are crossed natively; and a
  **single-arm figure-eight self-intersection** is DETECTED + traced-through as typed data by the
  S4-f guard — `branchPts=0`, distinct from this locus branch — though it is not yet split into
  sub-arcs; see the S4-e and S4-f slices below.)
- **Unlocks:** **Steinmetz is now unblocked** natively; the multi-arm `TraceSet` +
  `BranchNode` connectivity is available to S5 curved booleans for self-crossing loci.

#### S4-e — Singularities · ◐ TWO HONEST SLICES DONE AT THE BAR (analytic sphere-pole + cone-apex crossed; FREEFORM parametric pole crossed; curve cusp declined by IFT; asymmetric/higher-order + edge/seam degeneracies remain)
A **chart (removable) singularity** is where ONE surface's own `(u,v)` parametrization
degenerates while its 3D point + normal stay finite: a **sphere parametric pole**
(`v = ±π/2`, where `‖dU‖ = R·cos v → 0`) or a **cone apex** (signed radius
`R₀ + v·sin α = 0`, where the tangential `‖dU‖ → 0`). The intersection can be perfectly
**transversal** through such a point — the pair sine `‖n_A×n_B‖` need NOT collapse — yet
the S3 marcher breaks there: `advanceParams` solves each surface's single-surface 2×2
normal equations, and when that surface's `dU` row vanishes the 2×2 is rank-1, so the
`(u,v)` update is ill-conditioned even though the 3D residual + normal are fine (and the
pole sits on a non-periodic `v` edge, so the marcher also reports a spurious `BoundaryExit`
or step-crawls the node budget at the apex). The first slice
(`add-native-ssi-s4e-singularities`, archived `2026-07-05`, gated `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`,
additive to `marching.cpp` + new OCCT-free `chart_singularity.h`, default-**off**
`enableChartSingularities`) detects and steps across the pole/apex:
- **Single-surface chart witness (the S4-e detector, DISTINCT from S4-c/S4-d)** —
  `chartConditionAt` finite-differences each surface's `‖dU‖` against `‖dV‖·scale`; a
  collapse (`‖dU‖ ≪ collapseFrac·‖dV‖` AND `≪ collapseFrac·scale`) with a **finite normal**
  flags a pole/apex on THAT surface. Computed from ONE surface's own Jacobian — NOT the pair
  sine (the S4-c near-tangent witness, which need not collapse at a pole) and NOT a locus-
  tangent flip (the S4-d branch witness). A finite cap keeps `‖dU‖ = O(‖dV‖)` so a genuine
  domain boundary is NOT mistaken for a pole (it exits as a normal `BoundaryExit`).
- **Point-based fixed-plane-cut crossing** — at a detected collapse, `crossChartSingularity`
  makes a bounded sequence of fine POINT-BASED jumps along the fixed last-good forward
  tangent `t★` (the branch_point.h / S4-c cut: drive `A.point − B.point → 0` under an
  along-`t★` hyperplane), which NEVER touches the degenerate single-surface `dU`, so it stays
  well-posed exactly where `advanceParams` failed.
- **Loose chart map-back** — the singular surface's far-side `(u,v)` are re-seeded LOOSELY by
  continuity: a **sphere pole** continues on the OPPOSITE meridian (`u_out = u_in + π mod 2π`,
  the free-longitude jump) with the latitude reflecting; a **cone apex** is a single 3D point
  the straight curve passes through to the far nappe (`v → −v`). The corrector confirms these;
  the singular point itself is never emitted.
- **Honest guard (the honesty core)** — a node is emitted ONLY if it verifies on BOTH
  surfaces ≤ `onSurfTol` and makes real along-`t★` progress. On ANY failure (won't verify, no
  progress, or the crossing budget exhausted) the whole band is DISCARDED (roll back) and the
  march STOPS + defers → OCCT as a `NearTangent` gap counted in `nearTangentGaps`. No
  pole/apex-crossing point is ever fabricated.

**At the bar (host + sim, `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` ON):** a marched great circle crossing BOTH
sphere poles (`v = ±π/2`) that S3 TRUNCATES at the first pole (half loop, `len ≈ 3.1415`) is
now **FULLY traced** — `singularitiesCrossed = 2`, `nearTangentGaps = 0`, one closed loop,
`len` native `6.2829` vs OCCT `6.2832` (rel Δ 5.0e-05), every node on the OCCT
`GeomAPI_IntSS` locus + both surfaces ≤ 1.51e-07. A double-cone `∩` plane whose line passes
THROUGH the **cone apex** that S3 STEP-COLLAPSES at (`v` stalls at ≈ −0.04) is now **FULLY
traced across both nappes** — `singularitiesCrossed = 1`, `nearTangentGaps = 0`, bounded 159
nodes, `v ∈ [−2.00, +2.00]`, on-locus 7.11e-16 / on-surface 6.79e-16. Sim parity
`sphere-pole s4e singX=2 NTgaps=0 closed=1` and `cone-apex s4e singX=1 NTgaps=0 nodes=159`.
A genuine finite cylinder `v`-cap still exits as a `BoundaryExit` (chart machinery does NOT
misfire); the S4-c graze still crosses and the S4-d Steinmetz still traces with the flag on;
the 5 transversal pairs stay `nt = 0` bit-identical.

**Second slice — FREEFORM parametric pole (`add-native-ssi-s4e-general`, gated
`CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, additive):** a B-spline/NURBS surface with a **collapsed control ROW**
(the whole `u` line at a `v`-edge maps to one point — the spline analog of the sphere pole:
`‖dU‖ → 0`, finite point, finite-limit normal) is detected by the SAME single-surface witness
(the degenerate freeform normal `normalize(Sᵤ×Sᵥ)` is a finite near-zero `Dir3`, so
`normalFinite` holds and `collapsed` fires) and crossed by the SAME point-based corrector. The
**only** new code is the far-side re-seed: a freeform adapter carries `uPeriod == 0`, so the
analytic `u_in + π` meridian jump does not apply — instead `chartsing::freeformChartInvert`
recovers the far LONGITUDE by a point-only search for the `u` at the SAME near-pole latitude
whose surface point is nearest the continued 3D tangent target (fixed-latitude, so it never
collapses onto the degenerate tip; the corrector then verifies on both surfaces). The analytic
`uPeriod > 0` path keeps the exact `u_in + π` jump BIT-IDENTICAL. **At the bar:** a NATIVE NURBS
unit sphere (a `uPeriod == 0` collapsed-row surface of revolution — a genuine freeform pole,
OCCT-freeform-oracle-free) `∩` plane that S3 truncates at the first pole (half circle) is now
FULLY traced — `singularitiesCrossed = 2`, closed great circle, every node on both surfaces
`≈ 4e-16` (host) — and vs OCCT `Geom_SphericalSurface` `GeomAPI_IntSS`
(`freeform-pole s4e singX=2 NTgaps=0 closed=1 onCurve=1.51e-07 onSurf=1.51e-07`, native len
`6.2829` vs OCCT `6.2832`). The **must-still-defer control** is a collapsed-row Bézier cone-tip
whose pole sits on the `v=1` DOMAIN BOUNDARY (a genuine surface ENDPOINT, no far side): the
witness fires but the far-side re-seed cannot verify past a nonexistent surface, so it correctly
DEFERS (`singularitiesCrossed = 0`, `NearTangent` → OCCT) — no fabricated point past a real tip.

**Curve cusp — DECLINED (no dead code):** a cusp of the intersection curve (arclength velocity
→ 0) requires `‖n_A×n_B‖ → 0`; by the implicit-function theorem, with regular charts AND healthy
pair sine the intersection is a smooth regular curve, so "a curve cusp with regular charts and
healthy sine" is the EMPTY set — a cusp always coincides with the pair-tangency regime already
owned by S4-c (graze march-through), S4-d (branch routing), or an honest OCCT deferral. A
standalone single-surface cusp witness would be unreachable dead code, so NONE is added; curve
cusps route to the existing S4-c/S4-d/OCCT path.

- **Honest scope / risk:** the two **analytic chart singularities** (sphere pole, cone apex) and
  now the **freeform parametric pole** (collapsed spline/NURBS row) are crossed, each verified
  node-by-node on both surfaces + on the OCCT locus. Still DEFERRED → OCCT (reported, never
  faked): **asymmetric freeform poles** whose continued-tangent re-seed does not verify;
  **higher-order / edge / seam** degeneracies; a full brep **degenerate-pole B-spline SOLID
  through the boolean pipeline** (no native construct feeds a freeform-pole face to the marcher —
  the freeform-pole fixtures are hand-seeded, exactly as the analytic S4-e fixtures are); the
  **curve cusp** (declined above); and the **general self-intersection residual (S4-f)**. Any
  pole whose point-based crossing does not verify on both surfaces defers the same honest way.
- **Unlocks:** transversal intersection curves that pass through a sphere pole / cone apex / a
  freeform (collapsed-row spline) parametric pole are now traced end-to-end natively instead of
  truncating at the chart singularity.

#### S4-f — Self-intersection / small-loops · ◐ FIRST COMPLETENESS + LOOP-ROBUSTNESS SLICE DONE AT THE BAR
Adds no new geometry capability — it HARDENS the correctness/completeness of the curves S3
already traces. Two orthogonal parts, both additive + gated so the S3/S4-c/S4-d/S4-e controls
stay byte-identical (`src/native/ssi/{marching.h,marching.cpp}` + new OCCT-free
`src/native/ssi/completeness_critic.h`, `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`-gated, no `cc_*` change).

- **Robust TRUE-RETURN closure (always on).** S3 closed a loop on pure proximity
  (`distance(cur, seed) ≤ loopClose·h`), which FALSE-CLOSES a curve that merely re-approaches
  its seed / an earlier node while heading the other way. Closure is now a necessary-condition
  tightening: close only when the march has actually travelled a full circuit
  (`arcLen > 2·closeRadius`, the true-return gate) AND the return heading is tangent-continuous
  with the seed's outgoing tangent (`dot(fwdNow, seedFwd) ≥ closureTangentCos`, default 0.5).
  It can only REFUSE a close, never MAKE one — every truly-closing control still closes
  byte-identically, while an inflated-radius near-pass no longer truncates (fixture B: a crossing-
  spheres circle traced at 10× loopCloseFrac went from ~1.2% of the true length to ≥ 93%, default
  frac byte-identical at 99.6%).
- **Self-intersection guard (default off `enableSelfIntersection`).** A single arm that crosses
  ITSELF (a figure-eight section) is detected by a geometric segment-segment crossing test over
  the stitched polyline — two non-adjacent segments whose closest approach ≤ a tight touch radius
  at a TRANSVERSE angle (`|cos| < 0.7`, so a retrace / (anti)parallel doubling-back is excluded)
  — recorded as a typed `WLine.selfIntersection` (DATA), and the arm marches THROUGH it (never
  stopped, never closed). DISTINCT from an S4-d `BranchNode` (a locus flip, `‖nA×nB‖→0`, that
  spawns arms): a self-crossing keeps ONE arm, so `branchPoints == 0`. Off → byte-identical.
- **Adaptive completeness critic (default off `completenessCritic`).** After the initial fixed-
  resolution seed + trace, LOOP-UNTIL-DRY: build a coarse coverage grid over A's domain from the
  traced polylines (`critic::coverageOf` / `uncoveredBoxes`), re-seed FINER
  (`minPatchFrac *= criticRefineFactor` per round) at the SAME `onSurfTol` (a candidate that does
  not land on both surfaces is DISCARDED — never a fabricated seed), dedup the traced NEW branches
  by LOCUS vs all kept curves (so a finer re-trace of an already-found loop is not over-produced),
  keep the genuinely new ones. Stop after `criticDryRounds` (K) consecutive dry rounds or the cost
  cap (`criticMaxRounds` / `criticMaxCandidates`). Fixture A: a small loop missed at 1/16
  (recall 0.5) is RECOVERED (recall 1.0 on that fixture); fixture D: four disjoint loops rise from
  recall 0.25 to 1.0 — both stopped dry, no over-production (traced == true count).

**HONEST FRAMING (baked into the headers, tests, and this row):** completeness is MEASURED +
ASYMPTOTIC, never a proof. Below ANY fixed re-seed round a smaller loop can still be missed, so
`TraceSet.completenessResidual` / `RecallReport.residualAcknowledged` are ALWAYS true and the
critic reports the floor reached (`criticFloorFrac`, `criticStoppedDry`) — a fixture's recall→1
is scoped to that fixture at that floor, never a global claim. NEVER fabricates a loop, a closure,
or a seed; an unrecoverable loop is a reported measured recall < 1, a self-intersection is a
recorded typed crossing, a false-close is prevented (not a faked continuation).

Host gate green: `test_native_ssi_s4f_completeness` **6 cases, 0 failed** (fixtures A–D + the
transversal-loop and S4-d Steinmetz controls; NUMSCI ON CTest **33/33**, the S4-f TU ABSENT with
NUMSCI OFF). No tolerance weakened; `src/native/**` stays OCCT-free.

**S4-f DE-RISKS (does not unblock/complete) curved blends (#6) + wrap-emboss (#7)** — their
intersection seams are exactly the small-loop / self-intersecting / many-loop patterns this slice
hardens, but their assemblers stay S5/S6/S7. Global topology repair / watertight self-intersection
resolution (splitting a self-crossing arm, healing a self-intersecting shell) also stay the tail —
S4-f DETECTS + REPORTS + traces-through, it does not repair topology.

`BRepAlgoAPI_{Fuse,Cut,Common}`** (sim parity `native-pass=24`, 30 passed / 0 failed / 6 fall-backs
— the sphere∩sphere, the
Steinmetz bicylinder, the coaxial cone∩cylinder, the coaxial cone∩sphere SINGLE- and TWO-circle,
AND the coaxial cone∩cone op-sets are each COMPLETE 3/3 native; the harness runs each of the
sphere FUSE/CUT as an equal-R AND an unequal-R fixture; 6 honest fallbacks):
- **S5-a — through-drill cylinder∩cylinder COMMON** (unequal radii, transversal two-loop
  trace) — watertight, ΔV = 8.1e-04, ΔA = 2.8e-04.
- **S5-b — through-drill cylinder∩cylinder FUSE + CUT** (assembler-only extension: fat wall
  with the two mouths cut out + planar-facet caps + reversed tunnel band / protruding end
  tubes) — watertight, ΔV = 8.8e-05 (fuse) / 4.0e-05 (cut).
- **S5-c — sphere∩sphere COMMON / FUSE / CUT** (single closed seam; the op-set is now COMPLETE
  3/3 native). COMMON = the lens of the two inside-the-other (INNER) spherical caps; FUSE (A∪B)
  = the two OUTER caps (each sphere's far-pole cap) welded on the shared seam, `V = V(A)+V(B)−lens`;
  CUT (A−B, order-sensitive) = the OUTER cap of A + the INNER cap of B emitted REVERSED (inward
  normal, bounding the scooped cavity), `V = V(A)−lens`. All three share the SAME decimated seam
  and reuse one generalised `appendSphereCap(outer,reversed)` cap builder + `VertexPool` weld;
  direction-slerp cap facets, robust even when a cap apex sits at the sphere's parametric pole.
  Watertight, verified vs BOTH the analytic closed forms AND OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI`: COMMON ΔV = 4.1e-04

  (uneq) — all inside the 1% curved-parity bar, no tolerance weakened. Survival gate declines
  (→ NULL → OCCT) any non-transversal pair (tangent / containment / concentric).
- **S5-d — Steinmetz (equal-radius orthogonal cyl∩cyl) COMMON / FUSE / CUT** (the
  *branched-trace* op-set, now COMPLETE 3/3 native): a `steinmetzPreGate` (equal-R, orthogonal,
  crossing axes) fires ONLY on the S4 decline edge (`nearTangentGaps > 0`), RE-TRACES with branch
  points enabled, and `recogniseSteinmetzTrace` accepts only the canonical structure
  (`branchPoints == 2`, four `BranchArc` arms). The lune/arc split + `VertexPool` weld machinery
  is shared across all three ops; the difference is which fragments survive + cap handling.
  - **COMMON** — `buildSteinmetzCommon` splits each cylinder along its two arcs into the
    inside-the-other lune patches, keeps the four whose centroid is inside the other cylinder, and
    welds them into ONE watertight shell sharing the four arc seams and the two branch-point
    vertices (S5-a planar-facet + `VertexPool` discipline). Byte-identical to the S5-d baseline.
  - **FUSE (A∪B)** — `buildSteinmetzFuse` keeps the OUTSIDE wall regions of BOTH cylinders + all
    four original end caps, welded along the four arcs, `V = V(A)+V(B)−V(common)`.
  - **CUT (A−B)** — `buildSteinmetzCut` keeps A's OUTSIDE wall + A's caps + B's inside lunes
    emitted REVERSED (inward normal, bounding the carved channel through A), `V = V(A)−V(common)`.
  Verified vs **BOTH** the exact analytic inclusion-exclusion volumes (host) **and** OCCT

  changes `add-native-cone-boolean` (COMMON) + `complete-cone-cyl-fuse-cut` (FUSE + CUT), op-set

  `nearTangentGaps == 0`, no branch points, not passing through the apex — resampled into ONE pooled
  ring by the shared `coneCylSetup` prologue (exactly one `Cone` + one coaxial `Cylinder`, apex-free
  frustum extent, the seam `s*` strictly interior to the axial overlap). The split machinery is
  reused; the difference is which fragments survive + cap handling.
  - **COMMON** — `buildConeCylCommon` welds the min-radius-profile solid of revolution: a frustum
    band (below `s*`, inside the cylinder) welded to a cylinder-segment band (above `s*`, inside the
    cone) along the seam ring, closed by two disc caps (`appendRevolvedBand` + `appendDiskCap` +
    `VertexPool`). Byte-identical to the S5-e COMMON baseline.
  - **FUSE (A∪B)** — `buildConeCylFuse` keeps the OUTER wall regions of both operands (each band kept
    iff its mid-sample classifies strictly OUTSIDE the other solid) + the union's terminal disc caps
    + the annular step caps (`appendAnnulusCap`, fixed axial ±ẑ normal) where an end-cap disc
    protrudes, `V = V(A)+V(B)−V(A∩B)`.
  - **CUT (A−B, cone minuend, order-sensitive)** — `buildConeCylCut` keeps A's OUTER wall + A's
    terminal/annular caps outside B + the cylinder's INSIDE-A band emitted REVERSED (inward radial,
    bounding the carved cavity, pinching to the pooled seam ring) + B's end-cap disc inside A
    reversed. A DISCONNECTED solid (detached cone tip + conical washer — one shell of two closed
    components), `V = V(A)−V(A∩B)`.
  Verified vs a **DUAL oracle** — the analytic inclusion-exclusion closed form
  `V(A∩B) = V_frustum(rBot→Rc over [sLo,s*]) + V_frustum(Rc→rTop over [s*,sHi])`,
  `V_frustum(ra,rb,Δh) = (π Δh/3)(ra²+ra·rb+rb²)` (engine `ssiCurvedBooleanVerified` COMMON arm +
  the generic `booleanResultVerified` `V(A)+V(B)−V(A∩B)` / `V(A)−V(A∩B)` for FUSE/CUT with the native
  `buildConeCylCommon` as `V(A∩B)`, same 1% deflection-bounded tol) **AND** OCCT
  `BRepAlgoAPI_{Common,Fuse,Cut}` (sim), all watertight/closed/valid, no tolerance weakened:
  - COMMON: volN = 19.107 vs analytic 19.111355 vs OCCT 19.111, ΔV = 2.03e-04, ΔA = 9.89e-05.
  - FUSE:   volN = 41.618 vs analytic 41.62610 vs OCCT 41.626, ΔV = 2.04e-04, ΔA = 1.13e-04 (a GROW).
  - CUT:    volN = 13.349 vs analytic 13.35177 vs OCCT 13.352, ΔV = 2.03e-04, ΔA = 1.02e-04 (a SHRINK).
  The reversed `cyl − cone` CUT (wrong minuend) declines → NULL → OCCT; a mis-selected band /
  mis-oriented reversed fragment fails the self-verify and falls back — never faked.
- **S5-f — coaxial cone(frustum)∩sphere COMMON / FUSE / CUT** (the CONE∩SPHERE family; change
  `add-native-cone-sphere-boolean` archived `2026-07-07`, op-set now COMPLETE 3/3 native). All
  three share the SAME seam — a SINGLE closed S1-analytic circle (`intersectSphereConeCoaxial`, a
  QUADRATIC in the cone parameter with EXACTLY ONE root strictly interior to both extents — the
  sphere on the FRUSTUM side, so the seam does NOT cross the cone apex), `nearTangentGaps == 0`,
  `curveCount == 1` — resampled into ONE pooled ring by a shared `coneSphereSetup` prologue
  (exactly one `Cone` + one `Sphere`, the sphere centre ON the cone axis, apex-free frustum, the
  crossing `s*` strictly interior). The CONE side reuses the S5-e cone-wall split
  (`appendRevolvedBand` + `appendDiskCap`); the SPHERE side reuses the sphere-lens cap builder
  (`appendSphereCap`, inner/outer apex + reversed-normal flags); the two poles are CLASSIFIED
  against the cone into inner (inside) / outer (outside).
  - **COMMON** — `buildConeSphereCommon` welds the min-cross-section overlap: the cone wall band
    inside the sphere + the cone terminal disc inside the sphere + the sphere INNER cap (inside the
    cone, closing to the inner pole), all sharing the pooled seam ring. `V = V_frustum +
    V_spherical-segment` — a closed form.
  - **FUSE (A∪B)** — `buildConeSphereFuse` keeps the sphere OUTER cap (outside the cone, closing to
    the far pole) + the cone OUTER wall band (outside the sphere) + the cone terminal disc bounding
    the union, `V = V(A)+V(B)−V(A∩B)` (a GROW).
  - **CUT (A−B, cone minuend, order-sensitive)** — `buildConeSphereCut` keeps A's OUTER wall band +
    A's terminal disc cap(s) outside B + the sphere INNER cap emitted REVERSED (inward radial, the
    spherical dimple bounding the carved cavity, pinching to the pooled seam ring). Unlike the
    cone∩cylinder CUT this single-crossing CUT is CONNECTED (ONE closed component — a frustum with a
    spherical dimple), `V = V(A)−V(A∩B)` (a SHRINK). A sphere-minuend (`sphere − cone`) declines →
    NULL → OCCT.
  Verified vs a **DUAL oracle** — the analytic inclusion-exclusion closed form
  `V(A∩B) = V_frustum(r_c(sLo)→r_c(s*)) + V_spherical-segment(s*→pole)` (engine
  `ssiCurvedBooleanVerified` COMMON arm + the generic `booleanResultVerified` `V(A)+V(B)−V(A∩B)` /
  `V(A)−V(A∩B)` for FUSE/CUT with the native `buildConeSphereCommon` as `V(A∩B)`, same 1%
  deflection-bounded tol) **AND** OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_{Common,Fuse,Cut}` (sim), all
  watertight/closed/valid, no tolerance weakened:
  - COMMON: volN = 5.2546 vs OCCT 5.2558, ΔV = 2.41e-04, ΔA = 1.28e-04.
  - FUSE:   volN = 60.686 vs OCCT 60.718, ΔV = 5.22e-04, ΔA = 2.61e-04 (a GROW).
  - CUT (cone−sphere): volN = 27.202 vs OCCT 27.207, ΔV = 1.96e-04, ΔA = 1.34e-04 (a SHRINK).
  The reversed `sphere − cone` CUT declines → NULL → OCCT; a TWO-circle crossing (sphere passes
  fully through the cone / spans the apex), an apex-crossing / apex-in-extent frustum, and a
  TRANSVERSAL (non-coaxial) cone∩sphere (a quartic space curve) all decline → NULL → OCCT.
- **S5-g — coaxial CONE(frustum)∩CONE(frustum) COMMON / FUSE / CUT** (the CONE∩CONE family; op-set
  now COMPLETE 3/3 native). Two COAXIAL cone frustums whose walls `r_A(s)=R0_A+s·tanα_A` and
  `r_B(s)=R0_B+s·tanα_B` (s = axial projection onto the SHARED axis) meet where `r_A(s)=r_B(s)` — a
  SINGLE LINEAR equation → EXACTLY ONE analytic circle seam at `s*=(R0_B−R0_A)/(tanα_A−tanα_B)`,
  radius `r*=r_A(s*)`. This is the natural GENERALISATION of the S5-e cone∩cylinder pair (a cylinder
  is the `tanα_B==0` special case): the S5-g `coneConeSetup` prologue re-expresses cone B's wall in
  cone A's s-frame (handling an antiparallel axis) and the constant cylinder radius `Rc` becomes the
  linear `r_B(s)`. All the S5-e revolved-band + disc-cap + annulus-cap machinery
  (`appendRevolvedBand` / `appendDiskCap` / `appendAnnulusCap`) is REUSED verbatim; the difference is
  only WHICH radius profile the second operand contributes. `nearTangentGaps==0`, `curveCount==1`,
  seam cross-checked (height s* + radius r*) against the S3 trace, single STRICTLY-INTERIOR crossing.
  - **COMMON** — `buildConeConeCommon` welds the min-radius profile solid of revolution
    `r ≤ min(r_A(s), r_B(s))` over the shared axial span: the narrower-wall band below s* + the seam
    ring + the narrower-wall band above s* + two disc caps. `V = V_frustum(below) + V_frustum(above)`.
  - **FUSE (A∪B)** — `buildConeConeFuse` walks the max-radius outer profile over the union span as a
    corner list, emitting a revolved wall band per different-s pair (the wider operand, kept iff its
    mid classifies OUTSIDE the other) + a flat annulus cap per radial STEP + two terminal discs.
    `V = V(A)+V(B)−V(A∩B)` (a GROW).
  - **CUT (A−B, cone-A minuend, order-sensitive)** — `buildConeConeCut` keeps A's WIDER (r_A>r_B)
    side of the seam: a conical WASHER (A wall outward + B wall emitted REVERSED inward, pinching to
    the seam, closed by a flat annulus cap at A's end) + any A-only slice where B is absent (a
    possibly-detached component). `V = V(A)−V(A∩B)` (a SHRINK).
  Verified vs a **DUAL oracle** — the analytic frustum inclusion-exclusion closed form
  (`V_frustum(ra,rb,Δh)=(π Δh/3)(ra²+ra·rb+rb²)`, the intersection circle radius/height closed-form
  from the two cone equations) **AND** OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_{Common,Fuse,Cut}` (sim), all
  watertight/closed/valid, inside the 1% curved-parity bar, no tolerance weakened. Host fixture
  (cone A `r=0.5+0.5y` widening up, cone B `r=3.0−0.5y` narrowing up, both y∈[0,4], seam y*=2.5,
  r*=1.75): COMMON volN≈20.093 (analytic 20.093103), FUSE≈66.824 (66.824294, GROW), CUT (A−B)≈12.370
  (12.370021, SHRINK). CUT is order-sensitive — B−A is the OTHER single-sided washer
  (`V(B)−V(A∩B)`), a genuinely different watertight solid, confirming the minuend gate. A
  parallel-wall pair (equal half-angle → no proper transversal circle), an apex-crossing /
  apex-in-extent seam, and a TRANSVERSAL (non-coaxial) cone∩cone (a quartic space curve) all decline
  → NULL → OCCT.
- **S5-h — TWO-CIRCLE coaxial CONE(frustum)∩SPHERE COMMON / FUSE / CUT** (the natural extension of
  the single-circle S5-f pair; op-set now COMPLETE 3/3 native). A cone frustum coaxial with a sphere
  (centre ON the cone axis) whose wall crosses the sphere at TWO latitudes → TWO analytic circle
  seams s*_lo < s*_hi and a spherical ZONE between them — the "sphere pokes THROUGH the cone wall"
  pose. The seam quadratic `(1+tanA²)s² + 2(R0·tanA − sc)s + (sc²+R0²−Rs²)=0` now has BOTH roots
  strictly interior to the cone extent AND to the sphere's axial span, with the sphere the wider
  operand on the mid-band (`r_sphere > r_cone` between the seams) and inside beyond them (each polar
  cap inside the cone). Both circles are S1-analytic (radius ρ=r_cone(s*), station s*); the S3 tracer
  returns only ONE of the two co-resident loops (the documented S2 co-resident seeding-recall limit —
  see S4/NURBS §), so the `coneSphere2Setup` prologue computes BOTH circles itself and CROSS-CHECKS
  the traced seam(s) against the analytic roots (height + radius) — never trusting a missing loop, so
  a traced loop matching neither → decline. The two rings are canonical azimuth samples through a
  shared `VertexPool` so every band/cap/zone welds byte-identically. Machinery is REUSED: the CONE
  side is `appendRevolvedBand` + `appendDiskCap` (S5-e); each SPHERE polar cap is `appendSphereCap`
  (inner/outer + reversed flags, S5-c); the ONE new builder is `appendSphereZone` — a revolved sphere
  band between two seam rings, each meridian slerp-subdivided to follow the bulge (great-circle exact,
  pole-robust), for the FUSE mid-band.
  - **COMMON** — `buildConeSphere2Common`: the min-radius profile of revolution — sphere LOWER cap
    (poleM→seamLo, inside the cone) + cone frustum band (seamLo→seamHi, inside the sphere) + sphere
    UPPER cap (seamHi→poleP). `V = V_sph-seg + V_frustum + V_sph-seg` — a closed form. Symmetric.
  - **FUSE (A∪B)** — `buildConeSphere2Fuse`: cone wall (coneNear→seamLo) + the sphere ZONE bulge
    (seamLo→seamHi, the outward mid-band) + cone wall (seamHi→coneFar) + two cone terminal discs.
    `V = V(cone)+V(sphere)−V(COMMON)` (a GROW).
  - **CUT (A−B, cone MINUEND, order-sensitive)** — `buildConeSphere2Cut`: the sphere fully engulfs
    the cone cross-section on the mid-band, so the result PINCHES into TWO DISCONNECTED components
    welded into one shell — a lower cone-tip piece (coneNear→seamLo, scooped by the sphere lower cap
    REVERSED) + an upper piece (seamHi→coneFar, scooped by the sphere upper cap REVERSED).
    `V = V(cone)−V(COMMON)` (a SHRINK). A sphere-minuend `sphere − cone` declines → OCCT.
  Verified vs a **DUAL oracle** — the analytic inclusion-exclusion closed form (two spherical
  segments + one frustum; the two circles' radii/heights closed-form from the cone+sphere equations)
  **AND** OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_{Common,Fuse,Cut}` (sim), all watertight/closed/valid, inside the 1%
  curved-parity bar, no tolerance weakened. Host fixture (cone r(y)=0.5+0.5y, y∈[0,4]; sphere Rs=1.6,
  centre (0,2,0); seams y*≈0.62026/2.17974): COMMON volN=14.670 (analytic 14.674986, ΔV≈3.3e-4),
  FUSE volN=34.937 (analytic 34.945423, ΔV≈2.4e-4, GROW), CUT volN=17.786 (analytic 17.788138,
  ΔV≈1.0e-4, SHRINK). A single-crossing sphere (the S5-f case, ONE interior root), a sphere internally
  tangent (double root → near-tangent), a pole outside the cone, an apex-crossing seam, and a
  non-coaxial (transversal quartic) cone∩sphere all decline → NULL → OCCT (honest, never faked).
- **S5-i — TWO-CIRCLE coaxial CYLINDER(finite)∩SPHERE COMMON / FUSE / CUT** (the natural `tanα==0`
  special case of the S5-h cone∩sphere two-circle family — a cylinder is a cone with zero half-angle;
  op-set COMPLETE 3/3 native). A finite cylinder (radius Rc, axis coaxial with a sphere Rs > Rc whose
  centre lies ON the cylinder axis) whose wall crosses the sphere at TWO latitudes → TWO analytic
  circle seams and a spherical zone between them — the "sphere pokes THROUGH the cylinder wall" pose.
  The seam equation is EXACT and clean: `Rc = √(Rs²−(s−sc)²)` ⇒ `s = sc ± √(Rs²−Rc²) = sc ± h`, two
  circles of the SAME radius Rc at stations sLo=sc−h, sHi=sc+h. On the mid-band the sphere is the wider
  operand (bulges outside the cylinder); each polar cap is inside the cylinder, both poles strictly
  inside the cylinder's axial extent. Both circles are S1-analytic (the coaxial sphere∩cyl → 2-circle
  S1 pair); the S3 tracer returns ONE of the two co-resident loops (the documented S2 co-resident
  seeding-recall limit), so the `cylSphere2Setup` prologue computes BOTH circles itself and
  CROSS-CHECKS the traced seam(s) against the analytic roots (height + radius) — a traced loop matching
  neither → decline. NO new builder — the shared `appendSphereZone` was refactored to a
  centre+radius primitive (the S5-h wrapper delegates BIT-IDENTICALLY) so BOTH families share ONE zone
  builder; the cylinder wall is `appendRevolvedBand` (a straight ruling is EXACT on a cylinder) +
  `appendDiskCap` (S5-a/e); each SPHERE polar cap is `appendSphereCap` (inner/outer + reversed, S5-c).
  - **COMMON** — `buildCylSphere2Common`: the min-radius profile of revolution — sphere LOWER cap
    (poleM→seamLo, inside the cyl) + cylinder segment band (seamLo→seamHi, inside the sphere) + sphere
    UPPER cap (seamHi→poleP). `V = V_sph-seg + π·Rc²·(sHi−sLo) + V_sph-seg`. Symmetric.
  - **FUSE (A∪B)** — `buildCylSphere2Fuse`: cylinder wall (cylNear→seamLo) + the sphere ZONE bulge
    (seamLo→seamHi, the outward mid-band) + cylinder wall (seamHi→cylFar) + two cylinder terminal
    discs. `V = V(cyl)+V(sphere)−V(COMMON)` (a GROW).
  - **CUT (A−B, cylinder MINUEND, order-sensitive)** — `buildCylSphere2Cut`: the sphere fully engulfs
    the cylinder cross-section on the mid-band, so the result PINCHES into TWO DISCONNECTED components
    welded into one shell — a lower cyl-end piece (cylNear→seamLo, scooped by the sphere lower cap
    REVERSED) + an upper piece (seamHi→cylFar, scooped by the sphere upper cap REVERSED).
    `V = V(cyl)−V(COMMON)` (a SHRINK). A sphere-minuend `sphere − cyl` declines → OCCT.
  Verified vs a **DUAL oracle** — the analytic inclusion-exclusion closed form (two spherical segments
  + one cylinder segment; the two circles' radii/heights closed-form from the cylinder+sphere
  equations) **AND** OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_{Common,Fuse,Cut}` (sim), all watertight/closed/valid, inside
  the 1% curved-parity bar, no tolerance weakened. Host+sim fixture (cylinder Rc=1.0 about +Y,
  y∈[−3,3]; sphere Rs=1.6, centre origin; seams y*=±√1.56≈±1.24900, radius 1.0; the S3 tracer here
  recovers BOTH co-resident circles, `curveCount=2`):
  - COMMON: volN=8.9937 vs analytic 8.995681 vs OCCT 8.9957, ΔV=2.24e-04, ΔA=9.61e-05.
  - FUSE:   volN=27.001 vs analytic 27.011160 vs OCCT 27.011, ΔV=3.76e-04, ΔA=1.65e-04 (a GROW).
  - CUT (cyl−sphere): volN=9.8521 vs analytic 9.853875 vs OCCT 9.8539, ΔV=1.84e-04, ΔA=1.07e-04
    (a SHRINK, two disconnected end pieces).
  A sphere with Rs ≤ Rc (no proper
  two-circle crossing — internally tangent / nested), a sphere whose pole falls outside the cylinder's
  axial extent (a single-crossing end dent), and a non-coaxial (off-axis, transversal quartic)
  cyl∩sphere all decline → NULL → OCCT (honest, never faked).

Honest scope still declining → OCCT (measured NULL fallbacks, never faked):
- **oblique / multi-tube cyl∩cyl**, and other curved-curved families (cyl∩sphere,
  sphere∩box, freeform), the TRANSVERSAL (non-coaxial) cone∩cylinder / cone∩sphere / cone∩cone
  quartic space curve, apex-crossing / apex-in-extent frustums, parallel-wall (equal-half-angle)
  coaxial cone∩cone, the APEX-SPANNING / internally-tangent coaxial cone∩sphere crossing (the
  two-circle POKE-THROUGH pose is now native — S5-h; only the apex-spanning / tangent sub-configs
  still decline), and the sphere-minuend `sphere − cone` CUT → decline; plus any
  branched pair that is NOT equal-R orthogonal Steinmetz (unequal-R / non-orthogonal / ≠ 2 branch
  points / ≠ 4 arms). A disjoint Steinmetz pair (no seam) also declines for all three ops.
  (sphere∩sphere, Steinmetz, the coaxial cone∩cylinder, cone∩sphere single-crossing, the coaxial
  cone∩cone, the TWO-CIRCLE coaxial cone∩sphere, AND the TWO-CIRCLE coaxial cylinder∩sphere
  FUSE/CUT/COMMON op-sets are now COMPLETE 3/3 NATIVE — see S5-c/S5-d/S5-e/S5-f/S5-g/S5-h/S5-i above.)
Remaining S5 work: general (non-Steinmetz) branched pairs, transversal/apex cone
pairs, the apex-spanning / tangent cone∩sphere sub-configs, transversal (non-coaxial)
cone pairs, and more curved-curved families.

## NURBS Layer 2 — general-freeform measurement pass (empirical decline map) · ✅ MEASURED 2026-07-10 · ⛔ POST-HOC RECALL CAMPAIGN DECLINED 2026-07-11 · ✅ SCALE-ADAPTIVE INITIAL SEEDING LANDED 2026-07-11 (decline 28.5%→18.8%, DISAGREED==0) · ✅ LOCUS-COVERAGE ORACLE AUDIT + FREEFORM-PAIR SEEDING EXTENSION LANDED 2026-07-11 (true decline 18.8%; audit → 0 over-counts, residual 100% genuine; extension → 18.8%→16.7%/17.4% combined, DISAGREED==0) · ✅ SEED-CLUSTER DISTINCT-BRANCH SPLIT LANDED 2026-07-11 (decline 16.7%→13.9%, multi-branch declines 19→14, DISAGREED==0)

Before scoping further S4 slices, the general NURBS↔NURBS boundary was measured empirically
with two differential fuzzers (verification only; `src/native` untouched, `cc_*` unchanged):

- **SIM native-vs-OCCT freeform fuzzer** (`tests/sim/native_ssi_freeform_fuzz.mm`,
  `scripts/run-sim-native-ssi-freeform-fuzz.sh`) — random valid NURBS↔NURBS surface pairs
  (bicubic-ish, rational + non-rational, positioned to intersect) driven through the real
  `seed_intersection`+`trace_intersection` pipeline vs OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS`. Fixed tol onSurf
  `1e-6` / onCurve `1e-3` / occt `1e-7`, never widened.
- **HOST exact-oracle fuzzer** (`tests/native/test_native_ssi_exact_fuzz.cpp`) — S1 analytic
  breadth + NURBS↔analytic known-answer (rational NURBS exactly representing quadrics ∩ plane),
  closed-form oracle, no OCCT, machine precision.

**Result — the no-silent-wrong invariant HELD for general NURBS SSI: `DISAGREED == 0`** across
800 SIM trials (10 seeds × N=40 ×2) + the HOST sweep. Native never traced a curve off both
surfaces and never declared completeness with a fabricated locus; the HOST leg confirmed the
traces it *does* produce are exact (nodes on both surfaces + on the known analytic curve to
`1e-15…1e-11`). **No real native SSI bug was found** — every early "native wrong" flag traced
to a harness/OCCT-oracle bug where native was in fact correct (conic-threshold `θ vs π/2−α`;
`GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnSurf` missing the global foot on wavy freeform patches; fit-bow measured
instead of corrected nodes), fixed harness-side without widening any tolerance.

**Decline rate ≈ 25% (24/96 canonical), and the histogram REDIRECTS the S4 priority:**

| decline reason | share of declines |
|---|---|
| **multi-branch** (OCCT found a loop native's seeding missed) | **83%** |
| **small-loop** (partial branch coverage) | **17%** |
| near-tangent marching stall | **0%** |
| no-seed / corrector-failed | **0%** |

**Key finding — the frontier is SEEDING-RECALL, not the near-tangent marching moat.** The
marcher steps through freeform grazes cleanly (the `near-tangent` decline bucket stayed empty
even on tightly-tuned glancing paraboloids); the declines are almost entirely
OCCT-found-a-branch-native-didn't. So the **highest-recovery next slice is targeted
seeding-recall on uncovered parameter cells** — generalize the existing
`completeness_critic` / `criticTargetedReseed` path (S4-f, already recovering small loops on
canonical fixtures) to arbitrary freeform multi-loop poses — NOT further S4-c/d near-tangent
march-through work. This reprioritizes the S4-d…f tail below.

**Also surfaced (a distinct S2/S3 slice):** the freeform `SurfaceAdapter` does not declare
**periodic/seam parametrization**, so a rational-NURBS full circle traces as an open arc
(~99.6% coverage) with a small seam gap; declaring `uPeriod` currently trips the near-tangent
detector on rational parametric-speed variation. A periodic-seam-aware adapter + seam-crossing
closure is a clean, bounded slice independent of the multi-loop recall work.

### Seeding-recall campaign (3 rounds, 2026-07-11) · ⛔ NOTHING LANDED — honest decline, baseline holds

A bounded workflow attacked the dominant **multi-branch** decline by generalizing the
`completeness_critic` / `criticTargetedReseed` seeding-recall path to arbitrary freeform
multi-loop poses. **Measured decline delta: 0.0 pt — baseline stands at ≈29.5%** (roadmap
canonical; the committed SIM fuzzer-as-shipped measured 28.5% throughout). **`DISAGREED == 0`
held in every configuration of every round — the hard no-silent-wrong invariant was never
violated, and every slice that would have broken a contract was reverted, tree restored clean
at HEAD `31765c5`.**

**Slices attempted and HONESTLY DECLINED (no commit):**

- **R1 — post-hoc critic recall generalization** (`completeness_critic.h` `coverageOf`
  `dilate=false` exact-cell mode + a new M1d covered-cell second pass re-seeding
  already-covered coarse cells at finer per-cell resolution). Default-OFF, DISAGREED-safe,
  verified not to regress S4-f canonical parity (small-loop 0.5→1.0, many-loops 0.25→1.0 all
  PASS). **Blocker: INERT on the unmodified fuzzer** — identical decline WITH and WITHOUT the
  edits at cell caps ≤256, rounds ≤8, floor to 1/256. FUZZ_DIAG proved the residual
  multi-branch declines are NOT co-resident transversal loops reachable by finer targeted
  re-seed (`critRecoveredLoops=0`, `criticStoppedDry=1` even at floor): they are near-tangent
  grazes the seeder correctly refuses (the S4-c moat) or OCCT arc-split over-counts of one
  native loop. The only levers that moved the fuzzer were **caller-side** `SeedOptions` on the
  measurement instrument (critic on → 21.5%; finer initial grid `initialGridU/V=12`,
  `minPatchFrac=1/64` → 17.4%, both DISAGREED=0) — editing the committed instrument to
  manufacture the win is disallowed; flipping `completenessCritic` default-on breaks the S4-f
  host BEFORE/AFTER contract (`test_native_ssi_s4f_completeness.cpp` asserts
  `before.tracedBranches==1`) and changes every SSI/boolean consumer — out of a single safe
  round's scope.
- **R2 — within-cluster distinct-branch split at the seeder** (`seeding.cpp` refine gained
  `clusterSplitDistinct/Frac/Cap`: the adjacency clustering merges two distinct small loops
  whose candidate boxes touch into one cluster and keeps only the tightest seed, dropping the
  second; the split emits every spatially-distinct refined seed per cluster, each still on BOTH
  surfaces at the SAME `onSurfTol`, marcher locus-dedup remains the correctness gate) + a
  coverage-halo width knob (`criticCoverDilation`). Default-OFF. **Blocker: self-verify
  INCOMPLETE at the commit gate** — the shipping-config end-to-end fuzzer run (≥3 seeds with
  `clusterSplitDistinct` on) was still executing when output was forced, and the host SSI test
  suite had not been re-run; the `dilation=0` experiment returned IDENTICAL numbers
  (halo is not this fuzzer's miss mechanism). Committing before both gate verifications pass
  would violate the self-verify-then-commit discipline, so the change was declined and reverted.

**Remaining dominant decline reason (honest residual / next frontier):** the multi-branch
declines are **NOT a POST-HOC seeding-recall gap** reachable by finer post-hoc re-seeding — that
hypothesis was tested to exhaustion and falsified. The genuine residual splits into (1)
**near-tangent grazes the seeder correctly refuses** — real S4-c/d marching-core moat work, not
recall; and (2) **OCCT arc-split over-counts** where OCCT reports one native loop as multiple
components (an oracle-side counting artifact, not a native miss). The only demonstrated,
DISAGREED-safe lever that lowers the decline is **initial seeding RESOLUTION** (finer initial
subdivision catches co-resident loops the post-hoc critic cannot, because the loops were already
inside one covered cluster). The productizable slice is therefore **scale-adaptive initial
seeding resolution inside `seed_intersection`** (default path finds more loops with no caller
knob) — now LANDED below.

### Scale-adaptive initial seeding resolution · ✅ LANDED 2026-07-11 (decline 28.5%→18.8%, DISAGREED==0)

The productizable slice deferred above is now shipped as a **DEFAULT** in `seed_intersection`
(`src/native/ssi/{seeding.cpp,patch_bounds.h}` only; OCCT-free, no `cc_*` change, no caller knob,
`src/native/boolean` untouched). The initial subdivision resolution (the initial-grid pre-split +
the leaf `minPatchFrac`) now ADAPTS to each operand pair's geometry so SIMPLE / canonical poses
are BYTE-IDENTICAL and only dense freeform multi-loop poses get finer initial seeding:

- **Adaptivity gate — FREEFORM↔FREEFORM density.** Two new scale-free, magnitude-independent,
  OCCT-free signals are set on the `SurfaceAdapter` at freeform-adapter-factory time:
  `freeformSpanCount` = spansU × spansV (polynomial-patch tiling = intrinsic density) and
  `freeformComplexity` = the control-net **multi-modal-line count** (a noise-band hysteresis
  counts the significant slope reversals per net row/column/coordinate; a plain
  bump/dish/tilted/monotone net scores 0, a genuine egg-carton scores high; wobble/jitter is
  filtered by a per-line flatness + retreat band). Both are 0 for ELEMENTARY / plane / torus
  surfaces (no control net), so any pair with an elementary operand — every S1 analytic pair,
  plane∩sphere, plane∩B-spline (the S4-f completeness fixtures), sphere∩Bézier — is left BYTE-
  IDENTICAL. Adaptivity fires ONLY on FREEFORM↔FREEFORM pairs whose leaner operand has ≥ 2 spans
  or a wavy net; a flat single-patch freeform pair is unchanged.
- **Strength — bounded.** A qualifying pair gets initial grid ×2 / leaf ½ (the proven sweet
  spot), stepping to grid ×3 / leaf ¼ for a dense-and-wavy pair, with hard caps (grid ≤ 16, leaf
  ≥ 1/256). Deterministic; `maxDepth` + the leaf floor still bound termination.
- **Why finer INITIAL seeding (not the post-hoc critic)** recovers these loops: a coarse initial
  grid bridges two close co-resident loops into ONE topological cluster, so the post-hoc critic
  (which re-seeds only UNcovered cells) never sees them as missing (`critRecoveredLoops=0`,
  confirmed in the declined campaign above). A finer INITIAL grid keeps them in SEPARATE clusters
  from the start — the mechanism the post-hoc path structurally cannot reach.

**At the bar (all gates, 3 seeds N=48 each):**
- **Freeform fuzzer** (`scripts/run-sim-native-ssi-freeform-fuzz.sh`, the UNMODIFIED committed
  instrument — its caller-side `SeedOptions` were NOT touched; the win comes entirely from the
  `src/native` default): decline **28.5% → 18.8%** (41 → 27 / 144), squarely in the target
  17–21% band and near the uniform-finer ceiling (18.1% measured for a caller-side
  `initialGrid=12, minPatchFrac=1/64`), but achieved ADAPTIVELY — only freeform↔freeform pairs
  finer, everything else unchanged. Multi-branch declines 35 → 19 (the recovered population is
  the multi-branch + near-tangent-family egg-carton poses). **`DISAGREED == 0`** on every seed.
- **SSI host suite** re-baselined CLEAN with **no assertion changes**: all 9 `test_native_ssi_*`
  pass (seeding, marching, s4_classification, s4e_singularities, **s4f_completeness** — its
  `before.tracedBranches==1` / fixture-D BEFORE/AFTER seed-count contracts stay byte-identical
  because those fixtures are plane∩freeform → the gate does not fire — exact_fuzz, boolean,
  curved_boolean). Timings unchanged (marching ~105 s, curved_boolean ~316 s), confirming the
  adaptive finer seeding does NOT blow up cost on the canonical cases.
- **SSI SIM parity** (`run-sim-native-ssi-marching.sh`): every pair PASS, residuals bit-matching
  the S3 record (bspline∩bspline onCurve 1.86e-07, sphere∩sphere lenΔ 1.58e-05, S4-c/S4-d slices
  green). (`run-sim-native-ssi-seeding-parity.sh` has a PRE-EXISTING `gp_Dir::Magnitude` OCCT-SDK
  compile error in the committed harness — verified present on clean HEAD, unrelated to this
  change, which touches no `tests/sim` harness.)

Honest framing carried forward: the residual 18.8% raises the RECALL FLOOR on the
co-resident/small transversal loops; it is not a completeness proof. (**The prior belief that
this residual was partly OCCT arc-split "over-counts" of one native loop was EMPIRICALLY
FALSIFIED by the locus-coverage oracle audit below: it is 0 — the entire residual is genuine
native seeding-recall of distinct OCCT loci.**)

### Locus-coverage oracle audit — the TRUE decline is genuine, not an over-count artifact · ✅ DONE 2026-07-11 (true decline 18.8%, 0 over-counts, DISAGREED==0)

The freeform fuzzer's native-vs-OCCT comparison was hardened into an EXPLICIT bidirectional
LOCUS-COVERAGE oracle (`tests/sim/native_ssi_freeform_fuzz.mm`; SIM harness only, `src/native`
untouched, `cc_*` unchanged) to settle whether the residual multi-branch declines were genuine
misses or OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` arc-split over-counts (OCCT splits one intersection locus into
several line components; a component/branch-COUNT comparison would mis-score native's single
correct loop as a decline whenever OCCT split it into more pieces than native traced).

- **The oracle compares LOCI, not counts.** Per OCCT line: (a) covered by native, (b) uncovered
  by native but covered by a SIBLING OCCT line native already covered — an arc-split OVER-COUNT
  credited to native (native traced the same geometric locus once; OCCT just chopped it), or (c)
  uncovered and on no other OCCT line — a GENUINE distinct locus native missed. The reverse
  residual now accumulates over genuine-miss lines only, so an over-count-only case falls through
  to AGREED regardless of how many arc-components OCCT emitted. Fixed onSurf/onCurve tolerances
  are REUSED, never widened; the DISAGREED gates (native node off both surfaces; native curve off
  the OCCT locus) are unchanged, so the no-silent-wrong invariant is preserved and STRENGTHENED
  (an over-count sibling can no longer be counted as native coverage of a locus it does not cover).
- **Measured (3 seeds, N=48, base 0x5515D1FF0F0F):** AGREED 117 / DECLINED 27 (**18.8%**) /
  DISAGREED 0 / ORACLE-INACCURATE 0. **LOCUS-COVERAGE AUDIT: 0 AGREED over-count trials, 0
  over-count decline lines, 39 genuine distinct-locus misses** (worst missed-locus 3D length
  ~2-6). **The TRUE decline equals the pre-audit 18.8% — the oracle was already coverage-correct;
  NONE of the "multi-branch declines" were OCCT over-counts.** The entire 18.8% residual is
  genuine native seeding-recall of distinct OCCT loci. `DISAGREED == 0` held.

### Freeform-pair scale-adaptive seeding extension — recover smooth co-resident loops · ✅ LANDED 2026-07-11 (decline 18.8%→16.7% primary / 19.1%→17.4% combined, DISAGREED==0)

With the audit proving the residual is genuine (not an oracle artifact), the seeding gate was
extended in `src/native/ssi/seeding.cpp` (OCCT-free, no `cc_*` change, no caller knob,
`src/native/boolean` untouched). The scale-adaptive gate previously fired ONLY on wavy/dense
freeform pairs (`minSpan ≥ 2 || osc ≥ 4`); the dominant remaining genuine misses were SMOOTH
freeform↔freeform pairs (low-span, non-wavy — two gently-bowed sheets / two paraboloids that
interpenetrate over a wide region and cross in MORE THAN ONE loop) that the coarse grid merged
into one cluster → one representative seed → the second loop missed. The gate now fires on ANY
freeform↔freeform pair; the STRENGTH still scales with density/waviness (base grid ×2 / leaf ½;
dense/wavy tier grid ×3 / leaf ¼), bounded by the same hard caps (grid ≤ 16, leaf ≥ 1/256):

- **Canonical safety — BYTE-IDENTICAL.** The gate keys off `freeformSpanCount ≥ 1` on BOTH
  operands. An ELEMENTARY / plane / torus operand has span count 0, so any pair with one — every
  S1 analytic pair, plane∩sphere, plane∩B-spline (the S4-f BEFORE/AFTER seed-count fixtures,
  which assert `before.tracedBranches == 1` / `curveCount() == 1`), sphere∩Bézier — is unchanged.
  The pure-freeform host fixtures assert INEQUALITIES (`branchCount() >= …`), so finer seeding
  keeps them green. **All 9 `test_native_ssi_*` host suites pass (seeding 9, marching 21, s4f 6,
  s4_classification 22, s4e 7, exact_fuzz 144-trial DISAGREED=0, boolean 4, curved_boolean 13);
  no assertion changes.**
- **Cost — flat.** Host marching 28.1 s → 29.0 s (+3%), seeding 3.40 s → 3.54 s (+3%): the
  elementary/mixed fixtures (gate off) are byte-identical work; the small pure-freeform fixtures'
  finer seeding is cheap. SSI marching SIM parity (`run-sim-native-ssi-marching.sh`) green.
- **Recall — a real, consistent gain (bounded).** Committed instrument (unmodified `SeedOptions`;
  the win is entirely the `src/native` default): decline **18.8% → 16.7%** on base 0x5515D1FF0F0F
  (27 → 24 / 144) and **19.4% → 18.1%** on base 0x1234ABCD (28 → 26 / 144) — **combined 6 seeds
  / 288 trials: 19.1% → 17.4% (55 → 50)**. Strictly in the right direction on BOTH bases; every
  Part-B decline index is a SUBSET of the baseline's (no previously-agreed case regressed). The
  recovered population is the smooth near-tangent-family / tilted-sheets co-resident second loops.
  **`DISAGREED == 0` on all 288 trials.** The caller-side finer-seeding CEILING (grid 12, leaf
  1/96) measured 9.7% — so meaningful genuine headroom remains, but is NOT bounded/safe to take
  everywhere (its cost is much higher); the landed default takes the bounded, canonical-safe slice.

**Remaining residual (honest / next frontier):** ~16-18% — the hard multi-branch moat. Many
remaining misses are second loci in pairs that ALREADY qualify for the gate yet still merge two
distinct loops into one seed at the ×2/×3 grid (the marching-core / seed-cluster-split frontier),
plus deeper co-resident structure the finer-everywhere ceiling (9.7%) reaches only at costs the
bounded default deliberately does not pay. The over-count-artifact hypothesis is closed (audited
to 0); the residual is genuine recall, attackable next only by seed-cluster distinct-branch
splitting or a targeted-cost critic — NOT by widening the initial grid further.

### Seed-cluster distinct-branch split — recover merged co-resident loops · ✅ LANDED 2026-07-11 (decline 16.7%→13.9%, multi-branch declines 19→14, DISAGREED==0)

The named next frontier ("seed-cluster distinct-branch splitting"). The param-box adjacency
clustering (`clusterRegions`) unites candidate regions whose param boxes touch on BOTH surfaces
into one cluster. Two DISTINCT co-resident transversal loops that a dense freeform pair hosts
close together can have touching candidate boxes and be MERGED into one cluster — the refine then
kept only the single tightest seed and DROPPED the second loop. This was the dominant residual
after the scale-adaptive seeding: audited GENUINE (0 over-counts), 79% of declines multi-branch,
each `traced=1 occtLines=2 genuineMiss=1` with the missed locus ~1.3 model-units off the traced
one. A prior workflow round (R2) attempted this exact idea but declined at an INCOMPLETE
self-verify gate (the shipping-config fuzzer run + host suite were not both re-run before the
commit was forced); this is the properly-verified re-attempt.

The refine pass (`refineClusters` in `src/native/ssi/seeding.cpp`, OCCT-free, no `cc_*` change,
`src/native/boolean` + `src/native/blend` untouched) now emits one seed per SPATIALLY-DISTINCT 3D
locus a cluster hosts, instead of only the tightest:

- **The distinct-branch split predicate — SINGLE-LINKAGE on the refined 3D points.** A cluster's
  accepted transversal seeds are grouped into connected components by single-linkage: two seeds
  join iff their 3D `point`s are within `sep = splitDistinctFrac · modelScale` (default `1/16`).
  A SINGLE physical loop's refined points tile it densely (consecutive candidate leaves are
  ~leaf-size apart, ≪ `sep`), so they chain into ONE component → the cluster still collapses to
  one seed (single-loop / canonical cases unchanged). Two loops separated in 3D by more than `sep`
  form TWO components → a seed per loop. The tightest seed of each component is emitted, capped at
  `splitMaxPerCluster` (default 8). Every emitted seed already passed the FULL refine gate — on
  BOTH surfaces at the SAME `onSurfTol`, transversal (‖n₁×n₂‖ ≥ `tangentSinTol`) — never a widened
  tolerance, never a fabricated seed. Scale-relative, deterministic, bounded.
- **Why it CANNOT over-produce a wrong result.** An over-split seed (two seeds that are actually
  the same loop, > `sep` apart) is HARMLESS: it re-traces the same loop and the S3 marcher's
  per-branch locus-dedup (`retraces` / `sameLocus` in `marching.cpp`) collapses the near-identical
  polyline. So the predicate is RECALL-ONLY — it can add a genuine second-loop seed or a harmless
  duplicate, never a curve off both surfaces. The marcher's locus-dedup remains the correctness gate.
- **FREEFORM↔FREEFORM GATE → canonical BYTE-IDENTICAL.** The split fires only when BOTH operands
  are freeform (`freeformSpanCount ≥ 1`) — the same gate the scale-adaptive seeding uses. Any pair
  with an ELEMENTARY / plane / torus operand (span count 0) keeps the running-tightest single seed
  per cluster (the pre-split path), so every S4-f BEFORE/AFTER seed-count fixture
  (`before.tracedBranches == 1`, `curveCount() == 1`, Steinmetz `branchPoints == 2`) and every
  exact-count seeding fixture (`branchCount() == 1` / `== 2`) is UNCHANGED. **All 9
  `test_native_ssi_*` host suites pass; no assertion changes; s4f runtime unchanged (8.2 s) —
  confirming zero added work on the byte-identical path.** SSI marching SIM parity
  (`run-sim-native-ssi-marching.sh`) green (19 passed, 0 failed).
- **Recall — a real, consistent gain (bounded).** Committed instrument (unmodified `SeedOptions`;
  the win is entirely the `src/native` default): decline **16.7% → 13.9%** on base 0x5515D1FF0F0F
  (24 → 20 / 144), with multi-branch declines **19 → 14** and genuine-miss lines **30 → 24**.
  Every one of the 3 seeds improved (declines 6→4, 7→6, 11→10); no previously-agreed case
  regressed. `DISAGREED == 0` on all 144 trials of the primary base and on an independent base
  (0xA11CE5EED, 3 seeds, 21.5% decline — a harder pose distribution, still 100% genuine, 0
  disagreed). **6 seeds total, DISAGREED == 0 throughout.**
- **Cost — flat.** Bounded single-linkage over per-cluster seeds (capped at 256 retained /
  8 emitted). Host `curved_boolean` 76 s → 80 s (+5%); the elementary/mixed path is byte-identical
  work. No blow-up on single-loop / canonical cases.

**Remaining residual (honest / next frontier):** ~14% — still the hard multi-branch moat, now
thinner. The remaining multi-branch declines are loops merged into a cluster whose refined points
CHAIN within `sep` (genuinely 3D-adjacent co-resident loops the single-linkage cannot separate
without risking a single-loop split), the near-tangent grazes the seeder correctly refuses (the
S4-c/d marching-core moat, not recall), and deeper co-resident structure the finer-everywhere
ceiling (9.7%) reaches only at costs the bounded default deliberately does not pay. The next
attackable lever is the S4-c/d near-tangent marching-core, not further seeding recall.

### SSI multi-branch floor (Wave-I / I1) — fit-density densify-refit + sharpened residual map · ✅ LANDED 2026-07-12 (fit-bow residuals lowered, DISAGREED==0; decline holds 9.7% — honest, no gate loosened)

The 9.7% freeform-fuzzer floor left after E1's co-resident-branch fix (`0x5515D1FF0F0F`+2, N=48×3
= 144 trials) was RE-MEASURED and its residual **anatomised per decline** to separate the honestly
recoverable part from the genuine person-decade moat. Baseline **AGREED 130/144 (90.3%),
HONESTLY-DECLINED 14/144 (9.7%), DISAGREED 0**; reason histogram **near-tangent 0, multi-branch 9,
small-loop 5** (the near-tangent MARCHING family stays EMPTY — confirmed again). A host replay of the
EXACT fuzz poses (OCCT-free, reproducing the fuzzer's splitmix64→xoshiro256** RNG + generator) joined
each decline's sim anatomy (`genuineOcctOnNat`, `worstMissLen`, `natOnOcct`) to its native trace
anatomy (per-loop node count, fitted `maxFitError`, between-node fit bow). The 14 declines split into
**three distinct sub-populations**, only one of which is a native geometry/recall gap:

- **FIT-DENSITY artifact on a DENSE high-curvature loop (recoverable fit quality) — the dominant
  small-loop sub-population.** On several tight glancing loops the marcher traces **1000+ on-locus
  nodes** (every node on BOTH surfaces ≤ `onSurfTol`, on the OCCT locus ≈ `natOnOcct` 2e-7…2e-6), yet
  the least-squares B-spline fit at the default 64-pole cap could NOT follow the curvature and BOWED
  off the on-locus polyline by ~2–5e-3. Because downstream coverage samples the FITTED curve (not the
  polyline), that bow read over the 1e-3 curve-coverage budget → a decline. This is a pole-COUNT
  artifact, not a corrector error, and is the S3 follow-up the roadmap named as "automatic
  densify-and-refit on a too-loose B-spline fit is not yet wired".
- **GENUINE distinct co-resident locus native's seeder missed (the real recall moat) — 3 declines**
  (`genuineOcctOnNat` ≈ 1.5…2.0, `worstMissLen` 2.8…4.8): native traced ≥ 1 locus and OCCT found a
  WHOLE separate co-resident locus. These are the residual after E1 — loops whose refined points CHAIN
  within `sep` (genuinely 3D-adjacent), which the single-linkage split cannot separate without risking
  a single-loop split. Attacking them further risks over-splitting one loop → declined (the documented
  hazard); this is the honest seeding-recall frontier, not a fit issue.
- **Sub-`onCurve` residual on a fully-traced loop (native-vs-OCCT curve divergence + node-spacing
  sagitta) — the rest.** `genuineOcctOnNat` sits at 1.0…1.6e-3, JUST over the fixed 1e-3 gate, with the
  fit already tight; the residual is the marcher's chord-deflection (`maxDeflection = scale·1e-3`,
  looser than the 1e-3 coverage gate) between on-locus nodes plus a genuine ~1e-3 native-vs-OCCT
  divergence on a glancing loop. Recovering these needs curvature-adaptive marching (the moat), not fit
  poles or seeds.

**Landed (fit-quality, `src/native/ssi/marching.cpp` only — OCCT-free, no `cc_*` change,
`src/native/boolean` + `src/native/blend` untouched, no caller knob): DENSIFY-AND-REFIT the fitted
convenience curve.** `fitBSpline` now, when its worst deviation from the on-locus NODES
(`maxFitError`, already computed) exceeds a scale-relative target (`scale·2e-4`, below the 1e-3 gate
yet above a smooth loop's error) with room to add poles, refits ONCE at a higher bounded pole count
(200) so the curve rides the on-locus polyline. Strictly cost-bounded: ONE extra `O(m·poles²)` solve,
hard-capped poles, and a **node-count guard** (skip loops with `m > 2000` — a chart-singularity
pole-crossing loop can circulate to ~20 000 nodes where a 200-pole solve is both unaffordable AND
fruitless). It is a **NO-OP on a smooth loop** whose 64-pole fit already rides the nodes (byte-
identical single fit), and it is **DISAGREED-safe by construction**: the polyline (ground truth) is
unchanged and NO on-curve / on-surface tolerance is touched — more poles only pull the convenience
curve CLOSER to the already-on-locus nodes, never move a node or fabricate geometry.

- **Measured effect — residual SHARPENED, DISAGREED-safe, decline HOLDS.** The densify lowers the
  fit-density residual on the dense loops it targets (final sim: `4.778e-3 → 1.531e-3` on
  `0x5615d1ff10c2` case 32, a 1068-node loop; `1.589e-3 → 1.060e-3` on `0x5715d1ff1275` case 22, a
  1122-node loop; `3.510e-3 → 3.343e-3` on `0x5515d1ff0f0f` case 24), proving the ~3e-3 fit-bow
  component is genuinely removed — but **none crosses the fixed 1e-3 gate** (the remaining 1.0…1.6e-3 is
  the native-vs-OCCT + node-spacing residual above, not fit), so the **decline rate honestly HOLDS at
  9.7% (14/144), DISAGREED == 0** (AGREED 130/144 = 90.3%, histogram near-tangent 0 / multi-branch 9 /
  small-loop 5, unchanged from baseline). The decline count
  was NOT lowered by loosening any gate (refused) nor by fabricating a curve/seed (refused). The floor
  is now precisely mapped: **fit-density is no longer a contributor** to the residual — it is genuine
  co-resident-locus seeding recall (3) plus a sub-`onCurve` glancing-loop divergence (the rest), both
  of which are the person-decade moat (curvature-adaptive marching / co-resident recall), not a bounded
  slice.
- **Verification.** All 9 `test_native_ssi_*` host suites pass with **no assertion changes**
  (native_ssi 11, seeding 10, marching 22 incl. the new regression, s4_classification 22,
  s4e_singularities 7, s4f_completeness 6, exact_fuzz DISAGREED=0, boolean 4, curved_boolean 13). Cost
  bounded: s4e 36 s → 59 s (the moderate-node pole-crossing loops densify; the 20k-node loop is guarded
  out), s4f 31 s, curved_boolean unaffected (S5 boolean volumes within tol — the densified curves it
  consumes are strictly tighter). Regression fixture `march_densify_refit_high_curvature_loop` (the
  verbatim fuzz pose `0x5615d1ff10c2` case 32 — a rational-NURBS ∩ B-spline tight loop of 1068 on-locus
  nodes): asserts the densify FIRES (fit poles > 64), every node on both surfaces ≤ 1e-6, and the
  densified curve rides the on-locus polyline with between-node bow < 1e-3 (the ~5e-3 bow at 64 poles
  gone) — no tolerance widened.

**Honest conclusion (the sharpened I1 floor map):** the remaining 9.7% freeform-fuzzer decline is
**not fit-density** (now removed as a contributor) and **not near-tangent marching** (0, empty). It is
(a) **3 genuinely-missed co-resident distinct loci** whose refined seeds chain within `sep` — the
single-linkage seeding-recall frontier, unrecoverable without risking a single-loop over-split; and
(b) a **sub-`onCurve` (1.0…1.6e-3) native-vs-OCCT divergence + node-spacing sagitta** on fully-traced
glancing loops, recoverable only by curvature-adaptive marching (`maxDeflection` is `scale·1e-3`,
looser than the 1e-3 coverage gate). Both are the genuine SSI moat — a bounded, DISAGREED-safe slice
cannot lower the decline further without loosening the gate or fabricating geometry, which this track
REFUSES. The densify is a real product improvement (every downstream S5/S6/S7 consumer of a dense
`TraceSet` curve now gets a tighter fit) and the honest floor is now precisely characterised.

SSI + curved booleans total ≈ **1.5–3 py** (substrate-accelerated) for *usable*
coverage; full OCCT-grade robustness (S4) is the long tail. Recommended cadence:
**S1 first** (highest bang-for-buck, unlocks elementary-pair curved booleans via
S5-restricted), then S2→S3, with S4 hardened continuously and S5 following as soon
as S1 (elementary) or S3 (freeform) curves are available.

## Honest framing

- Each stage ships as a **narrow verified slice + explicit OCCT fallback** — like
  planar booleans, box∩cylinder, and native threads did.
- **S4 is why "drop OCCT" stays a long-horizon goal**: the intersection *algorithm*
  is tractable on our substrate; the *robustness* on adversarial real-world inputs
  is the person-decade OCCT moat, re-earned only incrementally. The
  **detection/classification** layer (S4-a coincident-region, S4-b typed
  tangent-contact) is now landed and verified vs OCCT; the **marching core**
  (S4-c march-through-tangency, S4-d branch points, S4-e singularities, S4-f
  self-intersection) is the remaining tail — a `NearTangentTransversal` is typed
  and handed to OCCT, never traced natively yet.
- Shape healing (#4) and STEP import (#3) remain **separate parallel tracks**
  also gating `drop-occt` (both have landed first native slices); IGES is DESCOPED
  (STEP-only). They are not part of this SSI roadmap.
