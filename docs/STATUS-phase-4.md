# CyberCadKernel — Phase 4 status (native rewrite, drop OCCT)

Honest, verification-anchored snapshot of Phase 4 — replacing the OCCT adapter
with native C++20, one capability at a time, until OCCT can be unlinked. Method,
verification model, and the full capability sequence live in the sub-roadmap
[`openspec/NATIVE-REWRITE.md`](../openspec/NATIVE-REWRITE.md). Nothing below is
claimed unless it was actually built and run in this environment.

Date: 2026-07-02 · Branch: `main`.

## TL;DR

- **Capability #1 `native-math` — done at the Phase-4 verification bar.** Both
  independent gates are green: host analytic unit tests (no OCCT, no simulator)
  and native-vs-OCCT numeric parity on the booted iOS simulator.
- **No regressions.** Host build + CTest **8/8** (7 existing + new
  `test_native_math`); `scripts/run-sim-suite.sh` stays **221 passed, 0 failed**.
- **Zero blast radius.** Native math lives entirely under `src/native/math/`,
  is included only by its own sources and the two test files, and is not
  reachable from the `cc_*` facade or the engine — no ABI change, no engine
  wiring in this capability.

## Method recap — native rewrite (clean-room, OCCT as oracle)

Native code is implemented **clean-room** from first principles and public
references (*The NURBS Book*: FindSpan A2.1, BasisFuns A2.2, CurvePoint A3.1,
CurveDerivs A3.2, SurfacePoint A3.5, SurfaceDerivs A3.6; de Casteljau for
Bézier). OCCT source is consulted only as a numeric/convention **oracle**
(`gp_*`, `BSplCLib`, `BSplSLib`, `PLib`, `ElSLib`), never copied. fp64
throughout, fixed evaluation order for determinism.

## Verification model — two independent gates over the same code

Because native code carries **no OCCT dependency**, every capability is validated
by two gates, and is "done at the bar" only when BOTH pass AND every existing
suite stays green:

1. **Host unit tests** — the native library compiles and unit-tests with
   `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++ -std=c++20`, no OCCT, no simulator,
   asserting analytic/known-value results (a known Bézier point, a transform
   identity, an exact elementary-surface normal). First roadmap gate.
2. **Simulator native-vs-OCCT parity** — on a booted iOS simulator (OCCT linked
   ONLY in the parity test), the native result is compared element-by-element
   against the OCCT oracle within a documented tight fp64 tolerance. Second gate.

## native-math result table

**Host analytic gate:** `test_native_math` (compiled with Homebrew clang 22.1.3,
`-std=c++20`, `CYBERCAD_HAS_OCCT=OFF`, `CYBERCAD_HAS_METAL=OFF`) reports
**ALL TESTS PASSED** — 55 analytic assertions across value types, Bézier /
B-spline / NURBS curves, tensor-product surfaces, and elementary surfaces. It is
one of **8/8** CTest targets green (with the 7 pre-existing tests: test_registry,
test_guard, test_scheduler, test_compute_backend, test_parallel_policy,
test_parallel_toggle, test_abi).

**Native-vs-OCCT parity gate** (`tests/sim/native_math_parity.mm`, booted iOS
simulator, arm64): **24 groups, 24 passed, 0 failed.** Max native-vs-OCCT numeric
error per group:

**Overall max numeric error across all groups: 1.486e-13** (nurbs-curve-D2),
~10⁶× under its 1.0e-07 tolerance.

### Files

Native library (OCCT-free, `src/native/math/`):

- `vec.h` — `Vec3` / `Point3` / `Dir3` fp64 value types + vector algebra.
- `transform.h` — 4×4 affine transform (compose / invert / apply to
  point / vector / direction).
- `bezier.h` / `bezier.cpp` — Bézier curve + surface via de Casteljau
  (rational via homogeneous coords + quotient rule).
- `bspline.h` / `bspline.cpp` — FindSpan / BasisFuns / CurvePoint / CurveDerivs /
  de Boor + tensor-product surface eval; NURBS via homogeneous coords.
- `elementary.h` — plane / cylinder / cone / sphere point + unit normal.
- `native_math.h` — umbrella header.

Tests:

- `tests/test_native_math.cpp` — host analytic gate (no OCCT).
- `tests/sim/native_math_parity.mm` — simulator native-vs-OCCT parity gate
  (own `main()`/runner; explicitly SKIPped by `run-sim-suite.sh`).

## Regression evidence

- Host build + CTest with Homebrew clang 22.1.3, `-DCYBERCAD_HAS_OCCT=OFF
  -DCYBERCAD_HAS_METAL=OFF`, fresh build dir: configure OK, build OK,
  **CTest 8/8 passed, 0 failed.**
- `scripts/run-sim-suite.sh` (iphonesimulator arm64): still
  **== 221 passed, 0 failed ==**. The `.mm` parity test is in the script's SKIP
  list and has its own runner, so the OCCT-only 221-assertion suite is unchanged.
- Isolation: `grep` across `src/` and `include/` finds no reference to
  `src/native/math/` headers from `src/facade/cc_kernel.cpp` or `src/engine/*`.
  The `.cpp` files compile into `libcybercadkernel` via the `src/*.cpp` GLOB but
  are dead code for every `cc_*` path.

## Per-capability status

| # | Capability | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `native-math` | **done at the bar** | Both gates green (55 host asserts + 24 parity groups, max err 1.486e-13); no regressions; not yet engine-wired (by design). |
| 2 | `native-topology` | ☐ planned | B-rep data model + exploration; oracle `TopoDS`/`TopExp`/`BRep_Tool`. Next up. |
| 3–7 | tessellation → construction → booleans → blends → exchange | ☐ planned | Proposed as each begins. |
| 8 | `drop-occt` | ☐ planned | Unlink OCCT once every capability is native. |
