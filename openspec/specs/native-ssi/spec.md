# native-ssi Specification

## Purpose
Native, OCCT-free surface-surface intersection (SSI) — the enabler for general
native curved booleans (SSI-ROADMAP payoff S5). This spec is **Stage S1**: exact
closed-form intersection curves (`Line` / `Circle` / `Ellipse` / `Parabola` /
`Hyperbola`) for the elementary-surface pairs that reduce to a degree-≤2 conic,
built over `src/native/math` only (IntAna-style closed form; no GeomAPI, no
numerics). Any pair outside this family (skew cyl∩cyl, general cone∩cone,
non-coaxial quadrics, oblique plane∩torus, torus∩curved, freeform) returns an
honest `NotAnalytic` status with no curve — the contract with S2 subdivision
seeding / S3 marching / S4 tangent-robustness / OCCT fallback. SSI is INTERNAL: no
`cc_*` entry point; verified at the `cybercad::native::ssi` C++ boundary against
the OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` oracle.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Native analytic SSI for the closed-form elementary-pair conic family

The kernel SHALL provide a native, **OCCT-free** surface-surface intersection
module (`cybercad::native::ssi`) that, given two native analytic surfaces from
`src/native/math/` (`Plane`, `Cylinder`, `Cone`, `Sphere`, `Torus`), returns
native intersection curve(s) — `Line` / `Circle` / `Ellipse` / `Parabola` /
`Hyperbola` (or `Point` for a tangent contact), built from native-math primitives
— that provably lie on **both** surfaces, for the following **closed-form** pairs
and placements (SSI Stage S1 scope):

- **plane ∩ plane** → a line (or coincident / parallel-with-no-intersection).
- **plane ∩ sphere** → a circle (or a tangent point / none).
- **plane ∩ cylinder** → parallel lines, a circle, or an ellipse, selected by the
  plane orientation relative to the cylinder axis (perpendicular → circle,
  parallel → 0/1/2 lines, oblique → ellipse).
- **plane ∩ cone** → a circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, or a degenerate case
  (apex point / line pair) by the conic-section rule.
- **plane ∩ torus** → the in-plane quartic, solved with the `native-numerics`
  polynomial-root substrate; the closed-form families (axis-perpendicular
  concentric circles, plane-through-axis two circles, Villarceau two circles) are
  returned as native curves.
- **sphere ∩ sphere** → a circle (or a tangent point / none).
- **sphere ∩ cylinder, COAXIAL** → up to two circles (or a tangent circle / none).
- **sphere ∩ cone, COAXIAL** → up to two circles (or a tangent circle / none).
- **cylinder ∩ cylinder, COAXIAL or PARALLEL** → coincident, parallel lines, a
  tangent line, or none.
- **cylinder ∩ cone, COAXIAL** → circle(s) at the solved height(s) (or tangent /
  none).

Each returned curve SHALL be expressed against a native frame with a `value(t)`
evaluator, and SHALL be self-verified (see the self-verification requirement)
before it is returned. Curve(s) SHALL match OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` for the same
operands within tolerance (kind, sampled-point distance, branch count). The module
SHALL be OCCT-free; only the plane∩torus handler MAY use the `native-numerics`
substrate, and the solver-free pairs SHALL build without NumPP/SciPP. No `cc_*`
signature or POD struct SHALL change.

#### Scenario: plane ∩ sphere returns the exact intersection circle
- GIVEN a sphere of radius `R` centered at the origin and a plane at signed
  distance `h` from the center with `|h| < R`
- WHEN the native SSI module intersects them
- THEN it SHALL return a single `Circle` of radius `√(R² − h²)` centered at the
  foot of the sphere center on the plane, lying in the plane
- AND every sampled point on that circle SHALL lie on both the sphere and the
  plane within tolerance

#### Scenario: plane ∩ cylinder selects line-pair / circle / ellipse by orientation
- GIVEN a cylinder of radius `R` and, in turn, (a) a plane perpendicular to the
  axis, (b) a plane parallel to the axis at axis-distance `< R`, and (c) a plane
  oblique to the axis at angle `θ`
- WHEN the native SSI module intersects each
- THEN case (a) SHALL return a `Circle` of radius `R`, case (b) SHALL return two
  `Line`s parallel to the axis, and case (c) SHALL return an `Ellipse` of
  semi-minor `R` and semi-major `R / cos θ`
- AND in every case each sampled curve point SHALL lie on both surfaces within tol

#### Scenario: plane ∩ cone yields the classic conic section
- GIVEN a cone of half-angle `α` and a cutting plane
- WHEN the plane is perpendicular to the axis / cuts all generators / is parallel
  to exactly one generator / cuts both nappes
- THEN the native SSI module SHALL return a `Circle` / `Ellipse` / `Parabola` /
  `Hyperbola` respectively (and a degenerate apex point or line pair when the
  plane passes through the apex)
- AND each sampled curve point SHALL lie on both the cone and the plane within tol

#### Scenario: coaxial quadric pairs return their circle(s)
- GIVEN a coaxial sphere∩cylinder, a coaxial sphere∩cone, and a coaxial
  cylinder∩cone
- WHEN the native SSI module intersects each
- THEN it SHALL return the closed-form circle(s) at the solved height(s) (zero,
  one tangent, or two circles, per the geometry)
- AND every sampled point of every returned circle SHALL lie on both surfaces
  within tolerance

#### Scenario: plane ∩ torus is solved as a planar quartic via the numeric substrate
- GIVEN a torus (major `R`, minor `r`) and a plane whose intersection is one of the
  closed-form families (axis-perpendicular, plane-through-axis, or Villarceau)
- WHEN the native SSI module intersects them, using the `native-numerics`
  polynomial-root substrate for the in-plane quartic
- THEN it SHALL return the corresponding native circle(s)
- AND every sampled point SHALL lie on both the torus and the plane within tol

### Requirement: Pair-dispatch classifies and returns NOT-ANALYTIC for out-of-scope pairs

The module SHALL provide a symmetric pair-dispatch that inspects the two operand
surface types and their relative placement and either routes to a closed-form
handler or returns a typed **NOT-ANALYTIC** result (`analytic == false`) with a
reason and an **empty** curve list. NOT-ANALYTIC pairs SHALL be **deferred** to the
S2 subdivision seeder / S3 marching or OCCT and SHALL NEVER be faked with an
approximate or fabricated curve. The dispatch SHALL return NOT-ANALYTIC for at
least: general/skew cylinder∩cylinder (a quartic space curve), general cone∩cone,
non-coaxial cone∩cylinder, torus∩curved (any torus pair other than the supported
plane∩torus), ANY NURBS/Bézier/B-spline/freeform operand, and any **near-tangent /
coincident** configuration where the closed-form branch is numerically unsafe.
`analytic == false` is a normal outcome (the deferral seam into S2), not an error.
The freeform and non-closed-form-quadric NOT-ANALYTIC pairs are exactly the input
set the S2 subdivision seeder targets.

#### Scenario: skew cylinder ∩ cylinder defers, not faked
- GIVEN two cylinders whose axes are neither coaxial nor parallel (a general
  quartic space-curve intersection)
- WHEN the native SSI dispatch classifies the pair
- THEN it SHALL return `analytic == false` with reason "out-of-scope pair" and an
  empty curve list — deferring to the S2 seeder / S3 or OCCT
- AND it SHALL NOT return any approximate or fabricated curve

#### Scenario: any freeform operand defers
- GIVEN a pair where at least one operand is a NURBS / Bézier / B-spline surface
- WHEN the native SSI dispatch classifies the pair
- THEN it SHALL return `analytic == false` with the freeform-surface reason and an
  empty curve list, deferring to the S2 seeder / S3

#### Scenario: non-coaxial quadric pair defers rather than approximating
- GIVEN a sphere∩cylinder (or sphere∩cone, or cylinder∩cone) whose axes are NOT
  coaxial (nor, for cyl∩cyl, parallel)
- WHEN the native SSI dispatch classifies the pair
- THEN it SHALL return `analytic == false` with the non-coaxial-quadric reason,
  deferring the general case to the S2 seeder / a later SSI stage

#### Scenario: near-tangent / coincident configuration defers
- GIVEN a supported pair in a near-tangent or coincident configuration where the
  closed-form branch is numerically unsafe
- WHEN the native SSI dispatch classifies the pair
- THEN it SHALL return `analytic == false` with the near-tangent/coincident reason
  rather than emit a fragile curve

### Requirement: Every analytic curve is self-verified to lie on both surfaces

Before returning any `IntersectionCurve`, the module SHALL sample it densely enough
for its kind and confirm that every sample satisfies **both** operand surfaces'
implicit equations within a tolerance derived from the operands' scale. If any
sample fails, the module SHALL downgrade the entire result to `analytic == false`
(reason: self-verify-failed) rather than return an unverified curve. This is the S1
instance of the roadmap's mandatory self-verify → OCCT-fallback discipline: S1
SHALL never emit a wrong or leaky curved result.

#### Scenario: a returned analytic curve passes the on-both-surfaces check
- GIVEN any supported pair that produces a closed-form curve
- WHEN the module has computed the curve
- THEN before returning it the module SHALL have verified that every sampled point
  lies on both surfaces within tolerance
- AND only then SHALL it return the curve with `analytic == true`

#### Scenario: a closed-form branch that fails self-verify is downgraded, not returned
- GIVEN a configuration whose closed-form branch produces a curve that does not
  satisfy both surfaces within tolerance
- WHEN self-verification runs
- THEN the module SHALL return `analytic == false` (reason: self-verify-failed)
  with an empty curve list — never the failing curve

### Requirement: SSI is an internal capability verified against OCCT with no ABI change

SSI SHALL be an **internal** native capability consumed by native booleans/blends
(the S5 on-ramp) and by the S3 marching tracer (which consumes S2 seeds), and SHALL
NOT be exposed through the `cc_*` C ABI: no `cc_*` entry point, signature, or POD
struct SHALL be added or changed by this capability. It SHALL be verified at the
SSI-function level (per `SSI-ROADMAP.md` §Verification model) by two gates: a **host**
gate (no OCCT) and a **sim native-vs-OCCT** gate (`GeomAPI_IntSS` / `IntPatch` parity
/ branch-recall) — the same internal parity discipline used for `native-math` and
`native-topology`. For the S1 closed-form pairs the host gate asserts known conics
with every sampled point on both surfaces; for the S2 seeding pairs the host gate
asserts known transversal branch counts with every seed on both surfaces, and the
sim gate reports the measured **branch recall** vs OCCT; for the S3 marching pairs
the host gate asserts known curve shapes (loop closure / boundary exit) with every
sampled WLine point on both surfaces, and the sim gate reports **curve parity**
(branch count / length / sampled point-to-curve distance) vs OCCT.

#### Scenario: native SSI matches OCCT GeomAPI_IntSS on a supported pair
- GIVEN a supported elementary pair built both as native `math` surfaces and as
  OCCT `Geom_*Surface`
- WHEN the native SSI module and OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` each intersect the pair on
  the simulator
- THEN the native curve(s) SHALL match OCCT's in kind, branch count, and sampled
  point-to-curve distance within tolerance, compared at the SSI C++ boundary
- AND no `cc_*` entry point SHALL have been called or added

#### Scenario: host analytic gate runs without OCCT
- GIVEN the native SSI module built for the OCCT-free host
- WHEN the analytic test suite runs the supported pairs and the out-of-scope pairs
- THEN each supported pair SHALL match its closed-form curve with all samples on
  both surfaces, and each out-of-scope pair SHALL return `analytic == false` with
  the correct reason — with no OCCT linked

#### Scenario: S2 seed set is verified against OCCT branch recall on the simulator
- GIVEN a transversal freeform or non-closed-form quadric pair built both as native
  `math` surfaces and as OCCT `Geom_*Surface`
- WHEN the native S2 seeder produces its seed set and OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` computes
  the same pair on the simulator
- THEN the harness SHALL report the native **branch recall** (native transversal
  branches carrying ≥1 seed ÷ OCCT transversal branches) and each native seed's
  on-both-surfaces residual, compared at the SSI C++ boundary
- AND no `cc_*` entry point SHALL have been called or added
- AND recall SHALL be **reported** (with the deferred-tangent branch count called
  out), not asserted to be 1.0 blindly

#### Scenario: S3 traced curves are verified against OCCT IntPatch curve parity on the simulator
- GIVEN a transversal freeform or non-closed-form quadric pair built both as native
  `math` surfaces and as OCCT `Geom_*Surface`, with its S2 seeds
- WHEN the native S3 tracer walks one WLine per seed and OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` /
  `IntPatch` computes the same pair on the simulator
- THEN the harness SHALL report **curve parity** — native branch count vs OCCT, and
  for each matched branch the curve length and the sampled point-to-curve distance
  (native samples projected onto OCCT's curve and vice-versa) within tolerance —
  plus each WLine's on-both-surfaces residual, compared at the SSI C++ boundary
- AND no `cc_*` entry point SHALL have been called or added
- AND the near-tangent gap count SHALL be **reported** (the S4 seam) rather than
  hidden, and whatever S3 cannot trace SHALL fall back to OCCT with the measured gap

### Requirement: Native subdivision seeding finds a seed per transversal intersection branch

The module SHALL provide a native, **OCCT-free** SSI Stage-S2 **subdivision seeder**
(`cybercad::native::ssi`) that, given two native surfaces from `src/native/math/`
(the elementary + torus surfaces AND the freeform Bézier / B-spline / NURBS surfaces,
each via its `point(u,v)` / `dU` / `dV` / `normal(u,v)` evaluator), returns a set of
**seed points** — **at least one seed on every distinct TRANSVERSAL intersection
branch / loop** — targeting exactly the **freeform** pairs and the **non-closed-form
quadric** pairs that S1's dispatch returns NOT-ANALYTIC for (skew cylinder∩cylinder,
general cone∩cone, non-coaxial cone∩cylinder / sphere∩cylinder / sphere∩cone, oblique
plane∩torus, torus∩curved, and any NURBS/freeform pair). The seeder SHALL:

- **Subdivide + prune.** Recursively subdivide each surface's `[u,v]` parameter
  domain into patches; bound each patch by an AABB — from the **control-net convex
  hull** for B-spline / Bézier / NURBS operands, and an analytic-or-sampled bound for
  the elementary + torus operands; **prune** every patch pair whose AABBs do not
  overlap and recurse on the overlapping pairs down to a size / depth threshold,
  yielding candidate regions that bracket the intersection.
- **Refine.** For each surviving candidate region, refine `(u1,v1,u2,v2)` using the
  `native-numerics` `least_squares` substrate to drive `S1(u1,v1) − S2(u2,v2) = 0` to
  a point that lies on **both** surfaces, **clamping** the parameters to each
  surface's range.
- **Dedup.** Cluster seeds that fall on the same branch (spatial proximity) so the
  output is ~**one seed per branch**.

Every returned seed SHALL lie on **both** surfaces within a scale-derived tolerance
and SHALL carry its parameters on **both** surfaces `(u1,v1,u2,v2)`. The seeder SHALL
be OCCT-free and consume only `native-math` (surface evaluators + control nets) and
`native-numerics` (`least_squares`, closest-point); the refine path SHALL be compiled
under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`. No `cc_*` signature or POD struct SHALL change. The
returned seed set SHALL be the input contract for S3 marching (one traced curve per
seed).

#### Scenario: freeform (NURBS) transversal pair gets a seed on every branch
- GIVEN two native NURBS surfaces that cross transversally in a known number of
  branches/loops
- WHEN the S2 subdivision seeder intersects them (recursive patch-AABB-overlap
  subdivision + `least_squares` refine + dedup)
- THEN it SHALL return at least one seed for each transversal branch, each seed
  lying on both surfaces within tolerance and carrying its `(u1,v1,u2,v2)`
- AND after dedup the seed count SHALL be ~one per distinct branch

#### Scenario: non-closed-form quadric pair (skew cyl∩cyl) is seeded, not deferred by dispatch
- GIVEN two cylinders whose axes are skew (S1 dispatch returns NOT-ANALYTIC)
- WHEN the pair is routed into the S2 subdivision seeder
- THEN the seeder SHALL return ≥1 seed on each transversal branch of the quartic
  intersection, each on both surfaces within tolerance with its `(u1,v1,u2,v2)`

#### Scenario: control-net convex hull bounds a freeform patch soundly
- GIVEN a B-spline / Bézier / NURBS surface patch over a param sub-box
- WHEN the seeder computes the patch AABB from the control-net convex hull
- THEN the AABB SHALL be a conservative (sound) bound of the surface over that
  sub-box, so a disjoint-AABB prune SHALL never discard a region that actually
  contains an intersection

#### Scenario: refine drives the residual onto both surfaces and clamps to range
- GIVEN a surviving candidate region bracketing a transversal branch
- WHEN the seeder refines its center with `least_squares` on
  `A.point(u1,v1) − B.point(u2,v2)`
- THEN the converged `(u1,v1,u2,v2)` SHALL be clamped to each surface's parameter
  range and the point SHALL lie on both surfaces within tolerance before it is
  emitted as a seed

### Requirement: Near-tangent, coincident, and degenerate seeding is deferred to S4, never faked

The S2 seeder SHALL target **transversal** intersections only. For a candidate
region whose refine **ill-conditions** — the surface normals are near-parallel
(`‖n₁ × n₂‖ ≈ 0` at the solution: a near-tangent branch), the surfaces are
coincident / overlapping, or the configuration is otherwise degenerate — the seeder
SHALL **NOT** emit a seed for that region. Instead it SHALL count the region as a
**deferred-to-S4 gap** (a reported diagnostic) and SHALL NEVER assign a fabricated or
mis-refined seed to it. `deferredTangent > 0` SHALL be a normal, first-class outcome
(the S4 seam), not an error.

#### Scenario: a near-tangent branch is reported as an S4 gap, not seeded
- GIVEN a pair with a near-tangent branch where the refine Jacobian ill-conditions
  (`‖n₁ × n₂‖ ≈ 0`)
- WHEN the S2 seeder processes the candidate region for that branch
- THEN it SHALL NOT emit a seed for that branch
- AND it SHALL increment the reported deferred-to-S4 count rather than fabricate a
  seed

#### Scenario: coincident / overlapping surfaces are deferred, not seeded
- GIVEN two surfaces that are coincident or overlap over a region (no discrete
  transversal branch)
- WHEN the S2 seeder processes that region
- THEN it SHALL defer it to S4 (reported), emitting no fabricated seed

### Requirement: Branch completeness is a measured recall figure, not a blind claim

The S2 seeder's completeness SHALL be reported as a **measured branch recall** —
(native transversal branches carrying ≥1 seed) ÷ (true / OCCT transversal branches) —
rather than asserted to be 100%. Missing a small loop because the subdivision was too
shallow SHALL be the acknowledged honest failure mode: it SHALL reduce the reported
recall and SHALL NOT be hidden or compensated with a fabricated seed. The subdivision
depth / minimum patch size SHALL be tolerance-scaled parameters that trade recall for
cost, and deeper subdivision SHALL be able to recover smaller loops.

#### Scenario: a small loop missed by shallow subdivision lowers reported recall
- GIVEN a pair with a small intersection loop and a subdivision depth too shallow to
  bracket it
- WHEN the S2 seeder runs and recall is measured against the true branch count
- THEN the missed loop SHALL lower the reported recall figure
- AND the seeder SHALL NOT fabricate a seed for the missed loop to inflate recall

#### Scenario: deeper subdivision recovers a small loop
- GIVEN the same small-loop pair run at a deeper subdivision depth
- WHEN the S2 seeder brackets the smaller region and refines it
- THEN it SHALL emit a seed for the previously-missed loop, raising the reported
  recall

### Requirement: Native predictor-corrector marching traces the full transversal intersection curve

The module SHALL provide a native, **OCCT-free** SSI Stage-S3 **marching-line
tracer** (`cybercad::native::ssi`) that, given the S2 `SeedSet` (≥1 seed per distinct
**transversal** branch, each with its `(u1,v1,u2,v2)` on both surfaces) and the two
native surfaces from `src/native/math/` (elementary + torus + freeform Bézier /
B-spline / NURBS, each via its `point(u,v)` / `dU` / `dV` / `normal(u,v)` evaluator),
**traces the full intersection curve** of each transversal branch and returns **one
WLine per seed** — a corrected polyline fitted to a B-spline — whose sampled points
provably lie on **both** surfaces within a scale-derived tolerance. The tracer SHALL:

- **Predict.** At the current corrected point, compute the intersection tangent
  `t = normalize(n₁ × n₂)` from the two surface unit normals
  (`normalize(dU × dV)` per surface), sign-continued with the current walk direction,
  and step to a predicted next point `Pₚ = P + h·t`.
- **Correct.** Re-project `Pₚ` back onto **both** surfaces with the `native-numerics`
  substrate — driving `A.point(u1,v1) − B.point(u2,v2) = 0` with `least_squares`,
  seeded by `closest_point_on_surface` per operand — landing the point on the
  intersection curve and advancing `(u1,v1,u2,v2)`, **clamped** to each surface's
  range. A corrected point SHALL be accepted only when its on-both-surfaces residual
  is ≤ tol; a predicted point SHALL NEVER be accepted uncorrected.
- **Adapt the step.** The step `h` SHALL be bounded by a scale/tol-derived
  `[h_min, h_max]` and SHALL **shrink** on high curvature / corrector strain
  (iteration count, correction distance, turn angle over a threshold) and **grow** on
  repeated clean steps — the recall/fidelity vs cost knob.
- **Terminate.** The walk SHALL stop on **loop closure** (the corrected point returns
  within a tol-scaled radius of the walk start after a minimum step count → a closed
  loop) or on a **boundary exit** (a corrected param leaves `[u0,u1]×[v0,v1]` on
  either surface → an open branch, marched in both directions from the seed), bounded
  by a max-step count so it always terminates.
- **Dedup.** A seed whose point already lies within a tol radius of an
  already-traced WLine SHALL be skipped (retrace), so the output is **one WLine per
  distinct transversal branch**.
- **Fit.** Fit a B-spline through the ordered corrected polyline via `native-math`,
  exposed as the WLine's `Geom`-quality curve, and **self-verify** it lies on both
  surfaces before it is returned.

Each returned WLine SHALL carry its polyline, its fitted B-spline, its
on-both-surfaces residual, and a termination status. The tracer SHALL be OCCT-free
and consume only the S2 `SeedSet`, `native-math` (surface evaluators + B-spline fit)
and `native-numerics` (`least_squares`, closest-point); the corrector and fit path
SHALL be compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`. No `cc_*` signature or POD struct
SHALL change. The returned WLines SHALL be the input contract for S5 curved booleans
(one WLine splits a curved face).

#### Scenario: a transversal closed-loop branch is traced and closes
- GIVEN a transversal pair whose intersection is a closed loop (e.g. a sphere
  piercing a freeform bump) and an S2 seed on that loop
- WHEN the S3 tracer marches from the seed (predict `n₁ × n₂` step → correct onto
  both surfaces → adaptive step)
- THEN the walk SHALL return within a tol-scaled radius of its start and terminate as
  a **closed loop**, and the fitted B-spline SHALL close (its endpoints coincide)
- AND every sampled WLine and B-spline point SHALL lie on both surfaces within tol

#### Scenario: a transversal open branch is traced to both boundary exits
- GIVEN a transversal pair whose intersection crosses the patch (e.g. two crossing
  cylinders) and an S2 seed on that branch
- WHEN the S3 tracer marches from the seed in both directions
- THEN each direction SHALL terminate at a **boundary exit** (a param leaving a
  surface's range), the branch SHALL be marked open, and its endpoints SHALL lie on
  the patch boundary
- AND every sampled WLine point SHALL lie on both surfaces within tol

#### Scenario: the corrector re-projects each predicted point onto both surfaces
- GIVEN a predicted point `Pₚ = P + h·t` and its parameter guess `(u1,v1,u2,v2)`
- WHEN the corrector drives `A.point(u1,v1) − B.point(u2,v2)` with `least_squares`
  seeded by closest-point and clamps the params to each range
- THEN the accepted point SHALL have on-both-surfaces residual ≤ tol before it is
  appended to the polyline
- AND a predicted point SHALL NEVER be appended uncorrected

#### Scenario: duplicate seeds on one branch dedup to a single WLine
- GIVEN two S2 seeds that both land on the same transversal branch
- WHEN the S3 tracer processes the second seed and finds its point already within a
  tol radius of the WLine traced from the first
- THEN it SHALL skip the retrace and increment the deduped-retrace diagnostic, so the
  branch yields exactly one WLine

#### Scenario: the fitted B-spline is self-verified on both surfaces before return
- GIVEN a traced corrected polyline for a transversal branch
- WHEN the tracer fits a B-spline through it and samples the fitted curve
- THEN it SHALL confirm every sample lies on both surfaces within tol before
  returning the WLine; if the fit residual exceeds tol it SHALL densify the polyline
  and refit rather than return a leaky fitted curve

### Requirement: Near-tangent, coincident, and degenerate marching is deferred to S4, never faked

The S3 tracer SHALL trace **transversal** branches only. When a march enters a
**near-tangent** region — the surface normals become near-parallel
(`‖n₁ × n₂‖ → 0`, so the predictor tangent degenerates and the corrector
ill-conditions), or the required step must shrink below `h_min` to converge — the
tracer SHALL **STOP** the march at that point, tracing the branch only **up to** the
tangent, and SHALL mark that WLine `NearTangent` and increment a reported
`nearTangentGaps` count (the S4 seam). It SHALL **NOT** force, extrapolate, or
fabricate any curve point past the tangent, and SHALL **NOT** claim a full trace that
stopped short. Likewise **coincident / overlapping** surfaces (no discrete branch to
march), **branch-point splitting** (a singular crossing of two branches), and
**self-intersection** resolution SHALL be **deferred to S4** — reported, not resolved
or faked. `nearTangentGaps > 0` SHALL be a normal, first-class outcome (the S4 seam),
not an error, mirroring S1's `NotAnalytic` and S2's `deferredTangent` stance.

#### Scenario: a branch running into a near-tangent region is traced up to it and flagged
- GIVEN a transversal branch that runs into a near-tangent region (`‖n₁ × n₂‖ → 0`)
- WHEN the S3 tracer marches into that region and the corrector fails / the step must
  shrink below `h_min`
- THEN the tracer SHALL STOP at the last transversal point, trace the branch only up
  to there, mark the WLine `NearTangent`, and increment the reported
  `nearTangentGaps` count
- AND it SHALL NOT emit any curve point past the tangent nor claim a full trace

#### Scenario: coincident / overlapping surfaces are deferred, not marched
- GIVEN two surfaces that are coincident or overlap over a region (no discrete
  transversal branch to walk)
- WHEN the S3 tracer is handed such a region
- THEN it SHALL defer it to S4 (reported), emitting no fabricated WLine

#### Scenario: a branch point / self-intersection is deferred, not split
- GIVEN a march that reaches a branch point (two branches crossing at a singularity)
  or a self-intersection of the curve
- WHEN the S3 tracer detects the degeneracy
- THEN it SHALL trace up to it and defer the split / resolution to S4 (reported),
  never fabricating the continuation

### Requirement: Traced curve fidelity is a measured native-vs-OCCT parity figure, not a blind claim

The S3 tracer's fidelity SHALL be reported as a **measured native-vs-OCCT curve
parity** — native branch count vs OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` / `IntPatch`, and for each
matched branch the curve length and the sampled point-to-curve distance (native
samples projected onto OCCT's curve and vice-versa) within tolerance — rather than
asserted to be a perfect trace. A branch stopped short at a near-tangent region SHALL
reduce the reported parity for that branch and SHALL be called out in the
`nearTangentGaps` count, never hidden or padded with fabricated points. Whatever S3
cannot trace robustly SHALL fall back to OCCT and be reported with the measured gap
(the roadmap's self-verify → OCCT-fallback discipline). The step-size and closure
parameters SHALL be tolerance-scaled knobs that trade trace cost for fidelity.

#### Scenario: native-vs-OCCT curve parity is reported per branch
- GIVEN a transversal pair traced natively and by OCCT on the simulator
- WHEN parity is measured
- THEN the harness SHALL report the native vs OCCT branch count and, per matched
  branch, the length delta and the max sampled point-to-curve distance within tol,
  plus each WLine's on-both-surfaces residual
- AND the near-tangent gap count SHALL be reported, not hidden

#### Scenario: a branch stopped at a tangent lowers reported parity, not faked
- GIVEN a branch that S3 traces only up to a near-tangent region
- WHEN parity is measured against OCCT's full curve for that branch
- THEN the shortened trace SHALL lower the reported parity (length / coverage) for
  that branch and be counted in `nearTangentGaps`
- AND the tracer SHALL NOT fabricate points to inflate the parity figure

### Requirement: The S3 TraceSet is the consumed input contract for S5-a curved booleans

The S3 `cybercad::native::ssi` `TraceSet` SHALL be the **input contract consumed by the
native S5-a curved boolean** (`src/native/boolean`): for a transversal elementary curved
face pair, the boolean SHALL obtain the `TraceSet` and use each transversal `WLine` — its
per-node `(u1,v1,u2,v2)` on both surfaces (the UV split track) and its fitted B-spline
(the shared seam edge) — to split the curved faces. The S5-a boolean SHALL consume a
`TraceSet` ONLY when it is fully transversal — `nearTangentGaps == 0` and every consumed
`WLine.status` is `Closed` or `BoundaryExit`; a `TraceSet` with `nearTangentGaps > 0`, or
any `NearTangent` / `Failed` WLine, SHALL be treated as the honest **S4 fallback
boundary** and SHALL NOT be consumed (the boolean declines → OCCT). The tracer SHALL NOT
change to serve this consumption — the contract is the already-shipped S3 output; no
`cc_*` entry point, signature, or POD struct SHALL be added or changed, and the SSI module
SHALL remain OCCT-free and compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` (like the S3 tracer).

#### Scenario: a fully-transversal TraceSet is consumed to split a curved face
- GIVEN a transversal elementary curved face pair whose S3 `TraceSet` has
  `nearTangentGaps == 0` and every WLine `Closed` or `BoundaryExit`
- WHEN the S5-a curved boolean consumes the `TraceSet`
- THEN it SHALL split each curved face along its WLine's `(u,v)` track and use the WLine's
  fitted B-spline as the shared seam edge, with every seam node on both surfaces ≤ tol
- AND no `cc_*` entry point SHALL have been added or changed

#### Scenario: a non-transversal TraceSet is the S4 fallback boundary, not consumed
- GIVEN an intersecting curved face pair whose S3 `TraceSet` reports
  `nearTangentGaps > 0` (or a consumed WLine is `NearTangent` / `Failed`)
- WHEN the S5-a curved boolean inspects the `TraceSet`
- THEN it SHALL decline to consume the trace (the honest S4 seam) and the boolean SHALL
  fall back to OCCT, reported — never splitting a face on a truncated or fabricated seam

### Requirement: The single closed TraceSet seam is the consumed input contract for the S5-c sphere∩sphere common

The S3 `cybercad::native::ssi` `TraceSet` SHALL be the input contract consumed by ALL THREE
native S5-c sphere∩sphere booleans (`src/native/boolean/ssi_boolean.cpp`): `buildLensCommon`
(COMMON), `buildLensFuse` (FUSE), and `buildLensCut` (CUT). For a transversal sphere∩sphere
pair, each boolean SHALL obtain the `TraceSet` and use the SINGLE `Closed` `WLine` — its
per-node `(u1,v1,u2,v2)` on both spheres (the seam-circle track used to fan each spherical
cap) and its shared 3D nodes (the seam vertices the caps weld on through the shared
`VertexPool`). The SAME seam SHALL split each sphere into an INNER cap (apex nearest the
other centre) and an OUTER cap (apex at the far pole); the ops differ ONLY in cap selection
and orientation: COMMON assembles the two INNER caps (the lens), FUSE the two OUTER caps
(the peanut), and CUT the OUTER cap of the minuend plus the INNER cap of the subtrahend
REVERSED (the scooped cavity). Each boolean SHALL consume the `TraceSet` ONLY when it is
fully transversal — `nearTangentGaps == 0` and the consumed `WLine.status` is `Closed`; a
`TraceSet` with `nearTangentGaps > 0`, a `NearTangent` / `Failed` WLine, or a seam that
spans a full sphere (coincident) SHALL be treated as the honest S4 fallback boundary and
SHALL NOT be consumed by any of the three ops (the boolean declines → OCCT). The tracer
SHALL NOT change to serve this consumption — the contract is the already-shipped S3 output;
no `cc_*` entry point, signature, or POD struct SHALL be added or changed, and the SSI
module SHALL remain OCCT-free and compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` (like the S3 tracer).

#### Scenario: a single closed TraceSet seam is consumed to weld the lens
- GIVEN a transversal sphere∩sphere pair whose S3 `TraceSet` has `nearTangentGaps == 0`
  and exactly one `Closed` WLine
- WHEN the S5-c curved boolean consumes the `TraceSet`
- THEN it SHALL fan each spherical cap from its pole to the WLine's shared 3D seam nodes,
  with every seam node on both spheres ≤ tol, and the two caps SHALL weld along that single
  seam
- AND no `cc_*` entry point SHALL have been added or changed

#### Scenario: the one closed seam feeds fuse and cut as it already feeds common
- GIVEN a transversal sphere∩sphere pair whose S3 `TraceSet` is one `Closed` WLine with
  `nearTangentGaps == 0` and `(u1,v1,u2,v2)` per node
- WHEN the native boolean path runs `Op::Fuse` or `Op::Cut`
- THEN the SAME single seam SHALL be decimated once (`decimateSeam` + `seamNodeTarget`) and
  shared by the two caps the op selects (two OUTER caps for FUSE; OUTER + reversed INNER for
  CUT), so the caps weld watertight along the ONE seam
- AND no additional trace, re-trace, or seam SHALL be required beyond the single closed
  circle S3 already produces

#### Scenario: a tangent / coincident sphere TraceSet is the S4 boundary, not consumed
- GIVEN a sphere∩sphere pair whose S3 `TraceSet` reports `nearTangentGaps > 0` (tangent
  spheres) or whose single WLine is `NearTangent` / spans a full sphere (coincident)
- WHEN any of the S5-c curved booleans (COMMON, FUSE, CUT) inspects the `TraceSet`
- THEN it SHALL decline to consume the trace (the honest S4 seam) and the boolean SHALL
  fall back to OCCT, reported — never welding on a truncated or fabricated seam

### Requirement: Native typed coincident / overlapping-surface detection (S4-a)

The kernel SHALL provide a native, **OCCT-free** coincident-surface detector in
`cybercad::native::ssi` that returns a TYPED `CoincidentRegion` describing the shared
locus of two native surfaces, classified as exactly one of `FullSurfaceSame` (the two
surfaces are the same locus), `OverlapSubRegion` (they coincide on a delimited parameter
sub-region, carrying the param bounds on EACH surface), `None` (not coincident), or
`Undecided` (coincidence suspected but the region cannot be robustly delimited).

On the **analytic path**, the detector SHALL decide `FullSurfaceSame` in closed form
from the surface frames and sizes for ALL elementary families — same plane (same normal
up to sign AND same signed offset), coaxial-equal cylinder, coaxial-equal cone (same
apex, collinear axis, equal half-angle), same sphere (same centre, equal radius), same
torus (same centre and axis, equal major and minor radius) — generalising the existing
`IntersectionStatus::Coincident` detection into a complete, consistent family while
keeping the shipped same-sphere and coaxial-equal-cylinder `Coincident` results
bit-identical. On the **seeded path** (`CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`), the detector SHALL detect
that two general/quadric surfaces coincide over a PATCH by verifying that BOTH the
on-both-surfaces point residual and the surface normals agree over a sampled sub-region
(not merely at isolated seeds), delimit the agreement boundary in parameter space, and
return `OverlapSubRegion` with those bounds — SUPPRESSING spurious seeds and marching
inside it. When the overlap boundary cannot be robustly delimited (partial agreement,
fuzzy boundary, ambiguous domain-edge touch) the detector SHALL return `Undecided` (→
OCCT) and SHALL NOT fabricate a region. `src/native/**` SHALL NOT link OCCT; no `cc_*`
entry point, signature, or POD struct SHALL be added or changed.

#### Scenario: analytic identical elementary surfaces classify FullSurfaceSame

- GIVEN two native elementary surfaces of the same kind occupying the same locus — same
  plane, coaxial-equal cylinder, coaxial-equal cone, same sphere, or same torus
- WHEN the S4-a detector classifies the pair
- THEN it SHALL return `CoincidentRegion` of kind `FullSurfaceSame`
- AND `intersect_surfaces` SHALL continue to report `IntersectionStatus::Coincident` for
  those pairs, now backed by the typed region, with the previously-shipped same-sphere
  and coaxial-equal-cylinder results unchanged

#### Scenario: a near-miss of an identical pair classifies None, not a false coincidence

- GIVEN a pair that is close to identical but shifted, rotated, or resized beyond the
  linear/angular tolerance (e.g. two spheres with slightly different radii, or two
  planes with a small offset)
- WHEN the S4-a detector classifies the pair
- THEN it SHALL return `CoincidentRegion` of kind `None` — it SHALL NOT report a
  coincidence for a pair that is not the same locus within tolerance

#### Scenario: two coincident freeform patches yield a delimited OverlapSubRegion

- GIVEN two freeform (Bézier / B-spline / NURBS) surface patches that coincide over a
  sub-rectangle of their parameter domains, with `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` built
- WHEN the S4-a seeded detector runs over the candidate region
- THEN it SHALL verify that both the on-both residual and the normals agree across the
  sampled sub-region, delimit the agreement boundary, and return `CoincidentRegion` of
  kind `OverlapSubRegion` carrying the parameter bounds on each surface
- AND it SHALL suppress spurious seeds and marching inside the delimited region

#### Scenario: an undelimitable overlap returns Undecided, not a guessed region

- GIVEN two surfaces whose coincident overlap boundary is partial or fuzzy, or touches a
  domain edge ambiguously, so the region cannot be robustly delimited
- WHEN the S4-a seeded detector attempts to delimit it
- THEN it SHALL return `CoincidentRegion` of kind `Undecided` (the engine falls back to
  OCCT, reported) — it SHALL NOT fabricate a region boundary

### Requirement: Native typed tangent-contact classification (S4-b)

The kernel SHALL provide a native, **OCCT-free** tangent-contact classifier in
`cybercad::native::ssi` that, given a surface pair (analytic) or a seeded solution where
‖n₁ × n₂‖ < `SeedOptions.tangentSinTol`, returns a TYPED `TangentContact` classifying
the contact as exactly one of `TransversalOnly` (no tangency — the normal path handles
it), `TangentPoint` (an isolated 0-dimensional contact — the point SHALL be emitted),
`TangentCurve` (the surfaces are tangent along a whole curve — the curve SHALL be
emitted where closed-form, else its existence flagged with the contact locus),
`NearTangentTransversal` (the surfaces graze but CROSS — an S4-c gap handed on to OCCT,
NOT traced through here), or `Undecided` (the local jet is ambiguous — → OCCT).

On the **analytic path**, tangent configurations SHALL be classified in closed form —
sphere∩sphere at `d = R₁+R₂` (external) or `d = |R₁−R₂|` (internal) → `TangentPoint`
carrying the centre-line contact point; coaxial sphere∩cylinder / sphere∩cone tangent
equator and a plane tangent along a cylinder ruling → `TangentCurve` carrying the tangent
circle / line; a plane tangent to a sphere → `TangentPoint`. Analytic tangency SHALL NOT
return `NearTangentTransversal` or `Undecided`. On the **seeded path**
(`CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`), the classifier SHALL type the contact by the LOCAL DIFFERENTIAL
GEOMETRY — the sign/rank structure of the relative second fundamental form (relative
normal curvature) in the shared tangent plane: sign-definite → `TangentPoint`; rank-1
(one near-zero eigenvalue) → `TangentCurve`; indefinite (grazes and crosses) →
`NearTangentTransversal`; within the model-scale-derived curvature-noise band →
`Undecided`. The classifier SHALL replace the blunt `SeedSet.deferredTangent`
increment with a typed `TangentContact` recorded per dropped near-tangent region, and
SHALL KEEP the `deferredTangent` integer as a compatibility summary count. It SHALL NOT
fabricate a seed for any tangent contact, SHALL NOT trace through a
`NearTangentTransversal` (that is S4-c → OCCT), and SHALL NOT hand-tune or weaken the
curvature band to force a verdict. `src/native/**` SHALL NOT link OCCT; no `cc_*` entry
point SHALL be added or changed.

#### Scenario: analytic tangent spheres classify TangentPoint and emit the point

- GIVEN two spheres at centre distance `d = R₁ + R₂` (externally tangent) or `d =
  |R₁ − R₂|` (internally tangent)
- WHEN the S4-b analytic classifier classifies the pair
- THEN it SHALL return `TangentContact` of type `TangentPoint` carrying the contact
  point, which SHALL lie on BOTH spheres within tolerance

#### Scenario: analytic surfaces tangent along a curve classify TangentCurve and emit the curve

- GIVEN a coaxial sphere∩cylinder tangent at its equator (cylinder radius equal to the
  sphere radius), or a plane tangent along a cylinder ruling
- WHEN the S4-b analytic classifier classifies the pair
- THEN it SHALL return `TangentContact` of type `TangentCurve` carrying the tangent
  curve (the equator circle / the ruling line), which SHALL lie on BOTH surfaces within
  tolerance

#### Scenario: a seeded near-tangent solution is typed by its relative normal curvature

- GIVEN a seeded refine solution with ‖n₁ × n₂‖ < `tangentSinTol`, with
  `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` built
- WHEN the S4-b seeded classifier evaluates the relative second fundamental form at the
  contact
- THEN it SHALL return `TangentPoint` when the form is sign-definite, `TangentCurve` when
  it is rank-1, `NearTangentTransversal` when it is indefinite, and `Undecided` when it
  is within the curvature-noise band
- AND the typed `TangentContact` SHALL be recorded on the `SeedSet` while
  `deferredTangent` is kept as a compatibility summary count, with NO seed fabricated

#### Scenario: a near-tangent transversal is classified and handed on, never traced through

- GIVEN a seeded near-tangent contact whose relative second fundamental form is
  indefinite (the surfaces graze but cross)
- WHEN the S4-b classifier types it
- THEN it SHALL return `TangentContact` of type `NearTangentTransversal` and hand it on
  as an S4-c gap (→ OCCT) — it SHALL NOT step through the tangency and SHALL NOT
  fabricate any intersection-curve points across it

#### Scenario: an ambiguous local jet returns Undecided, not a guessed type

- GIVEN a seeded near-tangent contact whose relative second fundamental form is within
  the model-scale-derived curvature-noise band (the type is not robustly decidable)
- WHEN the S4-b classifier types it
- THEN it SHALL return `TangentContact` of type `Undecided` (the engine falls back to
  OCCT, reported) — it SHALL NOT guess `TangentPoint`, `TangentCurve`, or
  `NearTangentTransversal`

### Requirement: The S3 near-tangent hand-off carries the typed contact (additive)

The S3 marching tracer (`src/native/ssi/marching.h`) SHALL carry the typed
`TangentContact` classification of WHY a march stopped at a tangency, additively,
WITHOUT changing the tracer's transversal-only stepping. A `WLine` whose `status` is
`TraceStatus::NearTangent` SHALL carry an optional `TangentContact` stop reason (computed
by the S4-b seeded classifier at the stop point); `TraceSet.nearTangentGaps` SHALL be
unchanged as a count. The tracer SHALL still stop AT the tangency and march only up to it
— it SHALL NOT step through the tangency (that is S4-c, out of scope). No `cc_*` entry
point SHALL be added or changed, and the marching entry points SHALL remain compiled
under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`.

#### Scenario: a march that stops at a tangency reports the typed reason

- GIVEN a transversal march that runs into a near-tangent region and stops with `status
  == TraceStatus::NearTangent`
- WHEN the tracer finalises the `WLine`
- THEN the `WLine` SHALL carry a typed `TangentContact` stop reason classifying the
  tangency (point / curve / near-tangent transversal), and `TraceSet.nearTangentGaps`
  SHALL still count that gap
- AND the number of traced nodes SHALL be unchanged from the pre-typing behaviour — no
  points SHALL have been fabricated past the tangency

### Requirement: Native near-tangent marching-through of a continuing curve (S4-c)

The kernel SHALL provide a native, **OCCT-free** near-tangent marching capability in
`cybercad::native::ssi` that, when the S3 marcher reaches a near-tangent region
(‖n₁ × n₂‖ below the near-tangent gate) whose intersection curve GENUINELY CONTINUES on the
same branch, MARCHES THROUGH the region and emits the FULL curve rather than truncating.
The capability SHALL use a robust corrector that stays well-posed as ‖n₁ × n₂‖ → 0 by
pinning the new node to a FIXED PLANE perpendicular to the LAST-GOOD intersection tangent at
arc-distance equal to the step (a constrained residual-minimization over the native-numerics
substrate — minimizing the on-both-surfaces gap subject to the fixed-plane cut — NOT the
along-local-tangent Newton corrector that degenerates as the local tangent ill-conditions).
It SHALL seed that corrector with a curvature-aware predictor that bends the first-order
guess by the discrete curvature of the last two accepted nodes, and SHALL cross the
minimum-clearance region with a reduced step, resuming the normal deflection-driven step
once ‖n₁ × n₂‖ recovers. Outside the low-sine band the transversal corrector, accept test,
and deflection controller SHALL be unchanged, so every transversal march is traced as
before. The near-tangent regions the marcher successfully crosses SHALL be reported
(a per-branch and per-`TraceSet` crossed count) and SHALL NOT be counted in
`nearTangentGaps` (they are completed arcs). `src/native/**` SHALL NOT link OCCT; no `cc_*`
entry point, signature, or POD struct SHALL be added or changed; the marching entry points
SHALL remain compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`.

#### Scenario: a currently-truncating near-tangent transversal curve is now fully traced

- GIVEN a surface pair whose intersection curve grazes a near-tangent region but genuinely
  continues on the same branch (e.g. two equal cylinders whose axes cross, whose S3 trace
  today stops at the grazing region with `TraceStatus::NearTangent`,
  `stopReason == NearTangentTransversal`, and `nearTangentGaps == 1`), with
  `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` built
- WHEN the S4-c near-tangent marcher traces the pair
- THEN it SHALL MARCH THROUGH the near-tangent region using the fixed-plane-cut corrector
  and the curvature-aware predictor, emit the FULL intersection curve, report the crossed
  region in the crossed count, and yield `nearTangentGaps == 0` for that curve
- AND every emitted curve node SHALL lie on BOTH surfaces within `onSurfTol`

#### Scenario: the transversal march outside the low-sine band is unchanged

- GIVEN a transversal surface pair whose intersection never enters the low-sine band
- WHEN the S4-c marcher traces it
- THEN the traced curve SHALL be identical to the S3 result (same nodes, same status, same
  counts) — the corrector, accept test, and deflection controller SHALL be unchanged outside
  the low-sine band

### Requirement: The crossable gate defers genuine tangency and branch crossings (S4-c honesty)

The S4-c marcher SHALL attempt to march through a near-tangent region ONLY when the S4-b
tangent-contact classification at the stall is `NearTangentTransversal` AND the local
configuration is a SINGLE-BRANCH graze (the curve continues on the same branch), and SHALL
VERIFY any crossing before accepting it. When the S4-b classification is `TangentPoint` (an
isolated 0-dimensional genuine tangency where the curve does NOT continue), `TangentCurve`
(the surfaces are tangent along a whole seam), or `Undecided` (the local jet is within the
curvature-noise band), OR when the stall is a BRANCH CROSSING (multiple curve branches
meeting — S4-d), OR when the fixed-plane corrector cannot converge on both surfaces at the
minimum step, the marcher SHALL STOP, record the typed `TangentContact` stop reason, count
the region in `nearTangentGaps`, and DEFER it (→ OCCT) — exactly as the S3/S4-b tracer does
today. A crossing arc SHALL be accepted only if every node on it lies on BOTH surfaces
within `onSurfTol` and advances monotonically along the last-good tangent onto a
far-side tangent consistent with it; a crossing that fails this verification SHALL be
DISCARDED and the march SHALL truncate at the band entry. The marcher SHALL NEVER fabricate
an intersection-curve point past a degeneracy and SHALL NEVER weaken a tolerance to force a
crossing; a region that cannot be robustly crossed SHALL remain an honestly reported gap.

#### Scenario: a genuine tangency still stops and is classified, never crossed

- GIVEN a genuinely tangent surface pair — two spheres at centre distance `d = R₁ + R₂`
  (externally tangent, an isolated `TangentPoint`), or a sphere tangent to a cylinder along a
  circle (a `TangentCurve`)
- WHEN the S4-c marcher encounters the tangency
- THEN it SHALL STOP, classify the contact (`TangentPoint` / `TangentCurve`), count it in
  the deferred / near-tangent-gap tally, and NOT march through it
- AND it SHALL NOT fabricate any intersection-curve point across the tangency

#### Scenario: a branch crossing is deferred to S4-d, not crossed

- GIVEN a near-tangent stall that is a BRANCH CROSSING (multiple intersection-curve branches
  meeting at the point — e.g. the exact saddle where two equal crossing cylinders' branches
  touch), so more than one continuing branch is present
- WHEN the S4-c crossable gate evaluates it
- THEN it SHALL STOP and DEFER the region (S4-d owns branch topology), counting it in
  `nearTangentGaps` — it SHALL NOT march a fabricated single branch through the crossing

#### Scenario: an unverifiable or non-convergent crossing truncates honestly

- GIVEN a near-tangent region classified `NearTangentTransversal` where either the
  fixed-plane corrector cannot converge on both surfaces at the minimum step (a deep,
  near-coincident band) or a tentative crossing arc fails the on-both-surfaces / monotone
  verification
- WHEN the S4-c marcher attempts the crossing
- THEN it SHALL DISCARD any tentative arc, STOP at the band entry, and count the region in
  `nearTangentGaps` (deferred → OCCT) — it SHALL NOT emit a partially fabricated arc and
  SHALL NOT weaken a tolerance to make the crossing pass

### Requirement: Native branch-point localization, arm enumeration, and routing (S4-d)

The kernel SHALL provide a native, **OCCT-free** branch-point capability in
`cybercad::native::ssi` that, when the S3/S4-c marcher reaches a genuine SELF-CROSSING of the
intersection locus (a point where multiple real intersection-curve arms meet — detected by the
existing S4-c transversality-sine COLLAPSE and raw-tangent FLIP that today force a defer),
LOCALIZES the branch point, ENUMERATES the outgoing arms, ROUTES the march down each arm, and
ASSEMBLES the multi-arm curve — rather than truncating at the crossing. The capability SHALL
LOCALIZE the branch point B as the on-both-surfaces point where the transversality sine
‖n₁ × n₂‖ reaches its minimum (≈ 0) along the approach, with B on BOTH surfaces within
`onSurfTol`. It SHALL ENUMERATE the outgoing arm directions as the REAL, distinct roots of the
tangent-cone quadratic formed from the local second-order structure of the two surfaces at B
(the relative second fundamental form restricted to the shared tangent plane) — a transversal
self-crossing (indefinite form) yielding two distinct tangent lines and hence up to four
outgoing rays; it SHALL return ONLY the real distinct directions and, when the quadratic has NO
two distinct real roots, it SHALL enumerate NO arms. It SHALL ROUTE each enumerated arm by
stepping off B a small distance along the ray, re-projecting onto both surfaces with the
fixed-plane corrector (verified within `onSurfTol`), then continuing the normal march to
termination; and it SHALL DEDUP an arm that retraces an already-traced arm and CONNECT the arms
meeting at the same branch point into a branch-point node in the assembled result. The
branch points the marcher localizes and routes SHALL be reported (a per-`TraceSet` branch-point
count and the localized point with its connected arm ids) and SHALL NOT be counted in
`nearTangentGaps`. Outside a detected branch point the transversal S3 trace and the S4-c
crossable-graze crossing SHALL be unchanged. `src/native/**` SHALL NOT link OCCT; no `cc_*`
entry point, signature, or POD struct SHALL be added or changed; the marching entry points
SHALL remain compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`.

#### Scenario: the Steinmetz self-crossing is now fully traced

- GIVEN two equal-radius cylinders (R = 1) whose axes cross orthogonally at the origin (the
  Steinmetz bicylinder — its intersection is two ellipses that CROSS each other at two branch
  points), whose S3+S4-c trace today stops at the branch point with `TraceStatus::NearTangent`,
  `stopReason == NearTangentTransversal`, `tracedBranches == 0`, and `nearTangentGaps == 1`,
  with `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` built
- WHEN the S4-d marcher traces the pair
- THEN it SHALL LOCALIZE both branch points (each on BOTH cylinders within `onSurfTol`, at a
  near-zero transversality sine), ENUMERATE the outgoing arms from the tangent cone, ROUTE the
  march down each arm, and ASSEMBLE the two crossing ellipses — reporting `branchPoints == 2`
  and yielding `nearTangentGaps == 0` for the traced structure
- AND every emitted curve node SHALL lie on BOTH surfaces within `onSurfTol`

#### Scenario: the transversal march and the S4-c graze are unchanged

- GIVEN a transversal surface pair whose intersection never reaches a branch point, and a
  surface pair whose intersection is a `NearTangentTransversal` single-branch graze the S4-c
  slice marches through
- WHEN the S4-d marcher traces them
- THEN the transversal traced curve SHALL be identical to the S3 result (same nodes, same
  status, same counts) and the graze SHALL still be MARCHED THROUGH by the S4-c crossing
  (reported in the crossed count, `branchPoints == 0` for both) — the branch machinery SHALL
  engage ONLY at a detected branch point

### Requirement: Branch-point honesty — isolated tangents end and unresolved branches defer (S4-d)

The S4-d marcher SHALL route arms out of a stall ONLY when it is a genuine branch point — a
self-crossing of the intersection locus whose tangent-cone quadratic has TWO DISTINCT REAL
roots (an indefinite relative second fundamental form). When the S4-b tangent-contact
classification at the stall is `TangentPoint` (an isolated 0-dimensional genuine tangency where
the curve does NOT continue — a sign-definite relative second form, equivalently no two
distinct real tangent-cone roots), the marcher SHALL let the curve END there and SHALL NOT
fabricate any outgoing arm. When the classification is `TangentCurve` or `Undecided`, when the
tangent-cone quadratic has a double root (a cusp / degenerate branch, out of scope), when the
branch point cannot be localized on both surfaces within `onSurfTol`, or when a would-be arm's
first step cannot be verified on both surfaces within `onSurfTol`, the marcher SHALL STOP,
record the typed `TangentContact` stop reason, count the region in `nearTangentGaps`, and DEFER
it (→ OCCT) — exactly as the S4-c tracer does today — or DROP the unverifiable arm. The marcher
SHALL NEVER fabricate an arm or an intersection-curve point past a degeneracy and SHALL NEVER
weaken a tolerance to force a branch; a branch that cannot be robustly resolved SHALL remain an
honestly reported gap.

#### Scenario: an isolated tangent point still ends, never sprouting arms

- GIVEN a genuinely tangent surface pair — two spheres at centre distance `d = R₁ + R₂`
  (externally tangent, an isolated `TangentPoint` with a sign-definite relative second form)
- WHEN the S4-d marcher encounters the tangency
- THEN it SHALL let the curve END at the isolated contact, classify it (`TangentPoint`), and
  enumerate NO outgoing arms (`branchPoints == 0`)
- AND it SHALL NOT fabricate any intersection-curve arm or point across the tangency

#### Scenario: a branch point that cannot be robustly resolved defers honestly

- GIVEN a suspected branch point where either the localization does not re-project onto both
  surfaces within `onSurfTol`, the tangent-cone quadratic has no two distinct real roots (a
  definite form or a double root), or a would-be arm's first step off the branch point fails
  the on-both-surfaces verification
- WHEN the S4-d marcher attempts to localize / enumerate / route it
- THEN it SHALL DROP any unverifiable arm, STOP at the stall, record the typed
  `TangentContact` stop reason, and count the region in `nearTangentGaps` (deferred → OCCT) —
  it SHALL NOT fabricate an arm or a point and SHALL NOT weaken a tolerance to force the branch

### Requirement: The S4-d branched TraceSet is the consumed input contract for the S5-d Steinmetz common

The S4-d `cybercad::native::ssi` branched `TraceSet` SHALL be the input contract consumed by ALL
THREE native S5-d Steinmetz-family branched curved booleans
(`src/native/boolean/ssi_boolean.cpp`): `buildSteinmetzCommon` (COMMON), `buildSteinmetzFuse`
(FUSE), and `buildSteinmetzCut` (CUT). For an equal-radius orthogonal crossing cylinder pair,
each boolean SHALL obtain the branched `TraceSet` by tracing with
`MarchOptions.enableBranchPoints = true` and use its two `BranchNode`s (the localized branch
points, each on both cylinders within `onSurfTol`) and its four `BranchArc` `WLine`s — each arm's
per-node `(u1,v1,u2,v2)` on both cylinders (the arc track used to split each wall into lune
patches) and its shared 3D nodes (the seam vertices the patches weld on, plus the two shared
branch-point vertices). The SAME four arcs SHALL split each cylinder wall into an INSIDE region
(the lune, inside the other cylinder) and an OUTSIDE region; the ops differ ONLY in fragment
selection, orientation, and cap handling: COMMON assembles the four INSIDE lunes (the
bicylinder), FUSE the four OUTSIDE lune walls plus both cylinders' two original disc end caps
(the outer envelope), and CUT the OUTSIDE walls plus disc caps of the minuend plus the INSIDE
lunes of the subtrahend REVERSED (the carved channel). Each boolean SHALL consume the branched
`TraceSet` ONLY when it is fully resolved — `nearTangentGaps == 0`, `branchPoints == 2` with
`branchNodes.size() == 2`, exactly FOUR `WLine`s all of `status == BranchArc`, every arm on both
cylinders within `onSurfTol`, and the two branch nodes connecting all four arms. A branched
`TraceSet` with `nearTangentGaps > 0`, `branchPoints != 2`, a WLine set that is not four
`BranchArc` arms, or arms that do not meet at the two branch nodes SHALL be treated as the honest
fallback boundary and SHALL NOT be consumed by any of the three ops (the boolean declines →
OCCT). The branched re-trace SHALL be entered ONLY after the DEFAULT (unbranched) trace has
declined AND the Steinmetz pre-gate (both cylinders, equal radii, orthogonal crossing axes)
matches, so the single-seam S3 transversal trace the S5-a/b/c paths consume is UNCHANGED. The
tracer SHALL NOT change to serve this consumption — the contract is the already-shipped S4-d
output; no `cc_*` entry point, signature, or POD struct SHALL be added or changed, and the SSI
module SHALL remain OCCT-free and compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` (like the S3/S4-d tracer).

#### Scenario: the branched Steinmetz TraceSet is consumed to weld the four lunes

- GIVEN an equal-radius orthogonal crossing cylinder pair whose S4-d branched `TraceSet`
  (`enableBranchPoints = true`) has `nearTangentGaps == 0`, `branchPoints == 2`, and exactly
  four `BranchArc` arms meeting at the two branch nodes
- WHEN the S5-d curved boolean consumes the branched `TraceSet`
- THEN it SHALL split each cylinder wall along its two arcs into the inside-the-other lune
  patches, with every arc node on both cylinders within `onSurfTol`, and the four lune patches
  SHALL weld along the four arcs and the two shared branch-point vertices
- AND no `cc_*` entry point SHALL have been added or changed

#### Scenario: the four arcs feed fuse and cut as they already feed common

- GIVEN an equal-radius orthogonal crossing cylinder pair whose S4-d branched `TraceSet` is
  fully resolved (`branchPoints == 2`, four `BranchArc` arms, `nearTangentGaps == 0`) with
  `(u1,v1,u2,v2)` per node
- WHEN the native boolean path runs `Op::Fuse` or `Op::Cut`
- THEN the SAME four arcs SHALL be oriented and pole-axis-resampled ONCE (the shared prologue) and
  shared by the fragments the op selects (both cylinders' OUTSIDE lunes plus their disc end caps
  for FUSE; the minuend's OUTSIDE lunes plus its caps plus the subtrahend's INSIDE lunes REVERSED
  for CUT), so the fragments weld watertight along the four arcs and the two shared branch-point
  poles
- AND no additional trace, re-trace, or arc SHALL be required beyond the four `BranchArc` arms
  the S4-d re-trace already produces

#### Scenario: a non-Steinmetz or unresolved branched TraceSet is the fallback boundary, not consumed

- GIVEN a branched `TraceSet` that reports `nearTangentGaps > 0` (an arm the S4-d marcher could
  not resolve), or `branchPoints != 2`, or a WLine set that is not exactly four `BranchArc`
  arms, or arms that do not meet at the two branch nodes
- WHEN any of the S5-d curved booleans (COMMON, FUSE, CUT) inspects the branched `TraceSet`
- THEN it SHALL decline to consume the trace (the honest fallback boundary) and the boolean
  SHALL fall back to OCCT, reported — never welding a shell on a truncated, mismatched, or
  fabricated branched structure

#### Scenario: the default single-seam trace is unchanged for non-Steinmetz pairs

- GIVEN a transversal surface pair whose DEFAULT (unbranched) trace is a clean single-seam
  transversal (a through-drill cylinder pair or a sphere-lens pair) OR any pair the Steinmetz
  pre-gate does not match
- WHEN the S5 curved boolean traces it
- THEN it SHALL consume the DEFAULT `TraceSet` (branch points OFF) exactly as the single-seam
  S5-a/b/c paths do, and SHALL NOT enter the branched re-trace — the branch machinery engages
  ONLY on the declined edge when the Steinmetz pre-gate matches

### Requirement: Native chart-singularity detection and point-based crossing (S4-e)

The kernel SHALL provide a native, **OCCT-free** chart-singularity capability in
`cybercad::native::ssi` that, when the S3/S4-c/S4-d marcher reaches a point where a SINGLE
surface's own `(u,v)` PARAMETRIZATION is singular (a sphere parametric pole where `‖dU‖`
collapses to zero, or a cone apex where the signed radius and hence `‖dU‖` collapses), while the
3D point and the surface normal remain well-defined, DETECTS the chart collapse, STEPS across the
singular band, and RESUMES the normal march — rather than truncating at the singularity. The
capability SHALL DETECT the singularity via a SINGLE-surface Jacobian rank-drop — `‖dU‖`
collapsing relative to `‖dV‖` and the model scale on one surface while that surface's normal
stays finite — and this detection SHALL be INDEPENDENT of the S4-c pair transversality sine
`‖n₁ × n₂‖` (which need not collapse at a pole) and the S4-d locus tangent flip. It SHALL STEP
across the singular band with a POINT-BASED corrector that does NOT depend on the degenerate
`dU` (the fixed-plane cut whose residuals use only the surface point and the last-good tangent),
mapping the far-side chart coordinates back LOOSELY — at a sphere pole pinning the arbitrary
longitude from the continuity of the incoming arc and clamping the pole latitude, and at a cone
apex treating the apex as a single 3D point the curve passes through. It SHALL enter the band
with a fine step so the singularity is resolved rather than leapt, and SHALL resume the normal
`(u,v)` march once `‖dU‖` recovers on both surfaces. The chart singularities the marcher steps
across and verifies SHALL be reported (a per-`TraceSet` chart-singularities-crossed count and a
per-`WLine` crossed count) and SHALL NOT be counted in `nearTangentGaps`. Outside a detected
chart singularity the transversal S3 trace, the S4-c crossable-graze crossing, and the S4-d
branch-point trace SHALL be unchanged. `src/native/**` SHALL NOT link OCCT; no `cc_*` entry
point, signature, or POD struct SHALL be added or changed; the marching entry points SHALL remain
compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`.

#### Scenario: the sphere-pole great circle is now fully traced

- GIVEN a unit sphere and a plane through the sphere's axis (the plane `y = 0`), whose
  intersection is a great circle passing through BOTH sphere parametric poles (`v = ±π/2`, where
  `‖dU‖` collapses), forced through marching, whose S3 trace today stops at the pole as a
  `BoundaryExit` covering only a single pole-to-pole meridian (arc length ≈ π, half the closed
  loop), with `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` built and chart-singularity handling enabled
- WHEN the S4-e marcher traces the pair
- THEN it SHALL DETECT the chart collapse at each pole, STEP across it with the point-based
  corrector (pinning the outgoing longitude from arc continuity), and RESUME the march on the
  opposite meridian — assembling the FULL closed great circle (arc length ≈ `2π` within the
  deflection tolerance, both meridians visited, both poles crossed), reporting at least two chart
  singularities crossed and yielding `nearTangentGaps == 0` for the traced curve
- AND every emitted curve node SHALL lie on BOTH surfaces within `onSurfTol`

#### Scenario: the cone-apex line is now crossed

- GIVEN a double cone whose apex is at the origin (reference radius zero at the apex) and a plane
  through the apex (the plane `y = 0`), whose intersection is a line crossing the apex and
  spanning both nappes, forced through marching, whose S3 trace today stalls just short of the
  apex (`‖dU‖ → 0` collapses the parameter step, exhausting the node budget) and never reaches
  the far nappe, with chart-singularity handling enabled
- WHEN the S4-e marcher traces the pair
- THEN it SHALL DETECT the chart collapse at the apex, treat the apex as a single 3D point,
  STEP across it with the point-based corrector, and RESUME the march on the far nappe — tracing
  the full apex-crossing line spanning both nappes in a BOUNDED node count, reporting at least
  one chart singularity crossed
- AND every emitted curve node SHALL lie on BOTH surfaces within `onSurfTol`

#### Scenario: the transversal march, the S4-c graze, and the S4-d branch trace are unchanged

- GIVEN a transversal surface pair whose intersection never reaches a chart singularity, a
  surface pair whose intersection is a `NearTangentTransversal` single-branch graze the S4-c
  slice marches through, and the Steinmetz bicylinder whose intersection self-crosses at two
  branch points the S4-d slice localizes and routes
- WHEN the S4-e marcher traces them
- THEN the transversal traced curve SHALL be identical to the S3 result (same nodes, same status,
  same counts), the graze SHALL still be MARCHED THROUGH by the S4-c crossing, and the Steinmetz
  SHALL still be assembled by the S4-d branch machinery (`branchPoints == 2`) — each with zero
  chart singularities crossed, because the chart machinery SHALL engage ONLY at a detected
  single-surface chart collapse

### Requirement: Chart-singularity honesty — genuine boundaries exit, cusps end, unresolved singularities defer (S4-e)

The S4-e marcher SHALL step across a `v`-edge only when it is a genuine PARAMETRIC SINGULARITY —
a sphere pole or cone apex where `‖dU‖` collapses while the surface normal stays finite. When the
`v`-edge is a genuine DOMAIN BOUNDARY (a finite surface's cap edge, where `‖dU‖` does NOT
collapse), the marcher SHALL let the curve EXIT as a boundary exit and SHALL NOT attempt a
crossing. When the intersection curve has a genuine CUSP endpoint (the curve velocity collapses
while both surfaces' charts are regular and the point-based step cannot continue through it), the
marcher SHALL let the curve END there and SHALL NOT fabricate a continuation. When a chart
singularity's far-side node cannot be re-projected onto both surfaces within `onSurfTol`, when the
crossing makes no real far-side progress, or when a pole's continuity-pinned outgoing node fails
the on-both-surfaces verification, the marcher SHALL DISCARD the crossing arc, STOP, record the
typed stop reason, count the region in `nearTangentGaps`, and DEFER it (→ OCCT) — reporting the
measured gap. The marcher SHALL NEVER fabricate a point across a singularity and SHALL NEVER
weaken a tolerance to force a crossing; a singularity that cannot be robustly crossed SHALL remain
an honestly reported gap.

#### Scenario: a genuine domain boundary still exits, never fabricating a crossing

- GIVEN a finite surface whose intersection curve runs to a real domain-boundary `v`-edge (a
  finite cylinder's cap edge, where `‖dU‖` does NOT collapse and there is no surface beyond the
  edge)
- WHEN the S4-e marcher reaches the edge
- THEN it SHALL let the curve EXIT as a boundary exit, reporting zero chart singularities crossed
- AND it SHALL NOT fabricate any curve node beyond the boundary

#### Scenario: a chart singularity that cannot be robustly crossed defers honestly

- GIVEN a detected chart singularity where either the far-side node does not re-project onto both
  surfaces within `onSurfTol`, the crossing makes no real far-side progress, or a pole's
  continuity-pinned outgoing node fails the on-both-surfaces verification
- WHEN the S4-e marcher attempts to step across it
- THEN it SHALL DISCARD the crossing arc, STOP at the singularity, record the typed stop reason,
  and count the region in `nearTangentGaps` (deferred → OCCT) — it SHALL NOT fabricate a point
  across the singularity and SHALL NOT weaken a tolerance to force the crossing

### Requirement: Native robust loop closure and self-intersection detection (S4-f part 1)

The kernel SHALL provide, in `cybercad::native::ssi`, a native, **OCCT-free** robust-closure and
self-intersection capability. Loop closure SHALL be a TRUE-RETURN test: a march SHALL declare a
closed loop ONLY when it returns within the loop-closure proximity radius of the SEED **AND** its
current forward tangent is CONTINUOUS with the seed's outgoing tangent (heading the way it left).
A march that returns NEAR the seed but heading substantially the OTHER way (a near-antiparallel
pass-through) SHALL NOT be declared closed; it SHALL continue to its true termination. This
true-return test SHALL reduce to the current proximity result for any curve that truly closes (it
tightens a necessary condition — it can only REFUSE a close the proximity test would have made,
never MAKE one), so the transversal S3 traces and every existing loop-closing case SHALL be
unchanged. The capability SHALL additionally DETECT a genuine SELF-INTERSECTION — the traced arm
crossing an EARLIER NON-SEED node of its own history within a tolerance-scaled radius with a
TRANSVERSE (non-continuation, non-retrace) tangent — and SHALL record it as a typed
self-intersection with its point and both surface parameters, WITHOUT declaring a loop close there
and WITHOUT stopping the march (the arm SHALL continue to its true termination). A self-intersection
SHALL be DISTINCT from an S4-d locus branch point: at a curve self-crossing both surfaces are
transversal (the pair transversality sine does not collapse) and no new arms emanate, so the
self-intersection witness (a node-history crossing) SHALL be independent of the S4-c pair sine and
the S4-d locus tangent flip. An arm merely running back over itself (a retrace, tangents nearly
parallel or antiparallel) SHALL NOT be reported as a self-intersection. The self-intersection guard
SHALL be behind a default-off switch; with it off the trace SHALL be byte-identical to the current
S3 result. The self-intersections detected SHALL be reported (a per-`WLine` count and typed list
and a per-`TraceSet` total). `src/native/**` SHALL NOT link OCCT; no `cc_*` entry point, signature,
or POD struct SHALL be added or changed; the marching entry points SHALL remain compiled under
`CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`.

#### Scenario: a curve passing near its seed the other way is not false-closed

- GIVEN an open or longer intersection curve whose S3 trace passes within the loop-closure
  proximity radius of the seed while heading substantially the OTHER way (a near-antiparallel
  pass-through), which the current pure-proximity test declares `Closed` and truncates at the
  near-pass, with `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` built
- WHEN the S4-f marcher traces the pair
- THEN it SHALL NOT declare the curve closed at the near-pass (the return tangent is not continuous
  with the seed's outgoing tangent) and SHALL continue the march to the curve's TRUE termination
- AND the traced curve SHALL match the analytic ground truth end-to-end (arc length / endpoints
  within tolerance), never fabricating a closure

#### Scenario: a genuine self-intersection is detected and traced through

- GIVEN a single-arm intersection curve that genuinely self-crosses (one arm passing through the
  same 3D point twice, headed differently, while BOTH surfaces stay transversal — distinct from an
  S4-d branch where the intersection locus branches into multiple arms), with the self-intersection
  guard enabled
- WHEN the S4-f marcher traces the pair
- THEN it SHALL DETECT the self-crossing as a typed self-intersection at the crossing point (on
  both surfaces within `onSurfTol`), report at least one self-intersection, and continue the arm
  THROUGH the crossing to its true termination — it SHALL NOT declare a loop close at the crossing
  and SHALL NOT step past it unrecorded
- AND the self-intersection SHALL be reported as distinct from an S4-d branch point (the trace of
  this fixture yields zero localized branch points)

#### Scenario: the transversal closure, the S4-c graze, the S4-d branch trace, and the S4-e crossings are unchanged

- GIVEN the 5 transversal surface pairs whose intersection curves close by returning to the seed
  tangent-continuously, the S4-c `NearTangentTransversal` graze, the Steinmetz bicylinder whose
  locus self-crosses at two S4-d branch points, and the sphere-pole / cone-apex pairs the S4-e
  slice crosses
- WHEN the S4-f marcher traces them (with the self-intersection guard off)
- THEN each transversal curve SHALL still close (identical nodes, status, and counts to the S3
  result), the S4-c graze SHALL still be marched through, the S4-d Steinmetz SHALL still be
  assembled (two branch points), and the S4-e pole + apex SHALL still be crossed — each with zero
  self-intersections reported, because the true-return closure reduces to the current result on
  truly-closing curves and the self-intersection guard is off

### Requirement: Native bounded adaptive completeness-critic re-seed with an honestly reported recall floor (S4-f part 2)

The kernel SHALL provide, in `cybercad::native::ssi`, a native, **OCCT-free** completeness-critic
capability that, after the initial fixed-resolution seed and trace, RECOVERS small intersection
loops the fixed subdivision floor (default leaf fraction 1/32) silently missed. The critic SHALL,
when enabled, compute the param regions NOT covered by any traced curve, RE-SUBDIVIDE those
uncovered regions at a FINER resolution than the previous round, refine each new candidate to a
point on BOTH surfaces at the SAME `onSurfTol` (a candidate that does not refine to an
on-both-surfaces point, or that is near-tangent, SHALL be DISCARDED — never a fabricated seed),
DEDUP the new seeds against all kept curves, and TRACE each genuinely new seed. The critic SHALL
REPEAT this re-seed round LOOP-UNTIL-DRY — stopping after a configured number of CONSECUTIVE rounds
that recover NO new branch — OR when a hard cost cap (a maximum number of rounds and a maximum total
number of re-seed candidate regions) is reached, whichever occurs first. Every recovered loop SHALL
be a VERIFIED on-both-surfaces seed that refined to a real curve; the critic SHALL NEVER fabricate a
branch. The critic SHALL be behind a default-off switch; with it off the seeding and trace SHALL be
byte-identical to the current fixed-resolution result. The capability SHALL report the completeness
FLOOR it reached — the finest re-seed leaf fraction, the number of rounds run, and whether it
stopped DRY (the configured dry rounds elapsed with no new branch) or on the COST CAP — together
with the MEASURED recall (native branches carrying at least one seed ÷ the true transversal branch
count), which SHALL NEVER be asserted a blind 1.0. The report SHALL ALWAYS acknowledge the RESIDUAL:
a loop smaller than the finest re-seed round can still exist, so completeness is MEASURED and
ASYMPTOTIC, not a guarantee. `src/native/**` SHALL NOT link OCCT; no `cc_*` entry point, signature,
or POD struct SHALL be added or changed; the critic SHALL be compiled under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`.

#### Scenario: a small loop below the fixed floor is recovered

- GIVEN a surface pair whose intersection has a small loop lying entirely inside one default (1/32)
  leaf cell, so the fixed-resolution seeder produces NO seed for it and the measured recall is below
  1 at the default resolution, with `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` built
- WHEN the completeness critic is enabled and the pair is traced
- THEN the critic SHALL re-seed the uncovered region at a finer resolution, refine a verified
  on-both-surfaces seed for the small loop, trace it, and recover the loop — raising the measured
  recall to 1 ON THIS FIXTURE at the reached floor, with at least one recovered loop reported and
  the reached leaf fraction finer than 1/32
- AND the report SHALL STILL acknowledge the residual (a loop smaller than the reached floor can
  still exist) — the recall figure is a MEASURED win on this fixture at this floor, not a
  completeness proof

#### Scenario: many small loops measurably raise recall vs OCCT, with the floor and residual reported

- GIVEN an adversarial surface pair with several disjoint small loops (the wrap-emboss / blend seam
  pattern), most of them below the fixed seeding floor, so the default measured recall is well
  below 1
- WHEN the completeness critic is enabled and the pair is traced
- THEN the critic SHALL MEASURABLY raise the recall over the default (recovering loops down to the
  reached floor via the loop-until-dry re-seed), and SHALL report the reached floor, the number of
  rounds, whether it stopped dry or on the cost cap, and the measured recall against the OCCT branch
  count
- AND the report SHALL acknowledge the residual (a loop below the reached floor can still be
  missed) — it SHALL NOT claim total completeness, and no branch SHALL be fabricated

#### Scenario: a re-seed candidate that does not verify is discarded, never fabricated

- GIVEN a completeness-critic re-seed round in an uncovered region where a candidate fails to refine
  to a point on both surfaces within `onSurfTol`, or is near-tangent
- WHEN the critic processes the candidate
- THEN it SHALL DISCARD the candidate and SHALL NOT emit a seed or a branch for it — the recovered
  set contains only verified on-both-surfaces seeds that traced to real curves
- AND a loop the critic cannot recover within its cost cap SHALL be reported as a measured recall
  below 1 with the residual acknowledged, never a faked branch and never a weakened tolerance
