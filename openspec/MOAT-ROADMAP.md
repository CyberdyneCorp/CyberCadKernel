# Dropping OCCT — the Moat Roadmap

The **complete remaining path** from "substantially native + OCCT fallback" to `#8
drop-occt` (unlink OCCT entirely). Everything reachable by a *bounded* native slice has
landed (see [NATIVE-REWRITE.md](NATIVE-REWRITE.md) and [SSI-ROADMAP.md](SSI-ROADMAP.md));
what remains is the **research-grade moat** — the small set of genuinely hard capabilities
that repeatedly blocked the bounded slices, plus the two *asymptotic* robustness tails that
have no finite "done" line.

Parent: [NATIVE-REWRITE.md](NATIVE-REWRITE.md) (#8 `drop-occt`). Enabler already built:
[SSI-ROADMAP.md](SSI-ROADMAP.md) (S1–S5 curve pipeline + curved booleans).

App migration readiness: see [docs/APP-MIGRATION-READINESS.md](../docs/APP-MIGRATION-READINESS.md)
— audits whether the CyberCad app can flip to the native engine. Finding: no B-class op blocks
the app (`fillet_edges_g2`/`thread_apply` = 0 app sites); the real work is app-side adoption of
the kernel product + an IGES decision + the M2/M3/M7b curved-blend/freeform-boolean A-envelope gaps.

## The non-negotiable discipline (every stage, no exceptions)

**OCCT is the ORACLE throughout implementation — it is NOT removed until the capability it
backs is PROVEN native.** This is the same rule every landed tier used and it does not
relax for the moat:

1. **Two gates per capability.** (a) *Host analytic* — the native result matches a
   closed-form / independent computation with no OCCT linked. (b) *Sim native-vs-OCCT* —
   on a booted iOS simulator (OCCT linked) the native result matches the OCCT oracle
   (`BRepAlgoAPI` / `BRepFilletAPI` / `BRepMesh` / `GeomAPI_IntSS` / `IntPatch` /
   `STEPControl_Reader` …) on volume / area / watertightness / topology / continuity.
2. **Self-verify → OCCT fallback, always.** The native builder returns NULL when it cannot
   robustly build; the ENGINE runs the mandatory watertight + correct-value self-verify and
   DISCARDS a bad native result, falling through to OCCT. A wrong/leaky native result is
   never emitted.
3. **No fabrication, no dead code, no weakened tolerances.** An honest decline (with the
   measured gap + the specific blocker) is a first-class outcome. Capabilities that cannot
   be built are documented, not faked. (Session precedent: general-branched booleans =
   geometrically impossible; NURBS booleans = decline at recognition; curve cusp = the S4-c/d
   witness by the IFT; foreign rational B-spline = the M0 mesh gap below.)
4. **`src/native/**` stays OCCT-FREE; the `cc_*` ABI is additive-only.** OCCT lives only in
   `src/engine/occt` (the oracle + fallback). The final `drop-occt` step deletes that engine
   — but only once every stage below is native AND the completeness bar (M6) is met.

## The keystone finding (why the moat has the shape it does)

The bounded slices this project shipped repeatedly declined at **one recurring blocker**:
a general **foreign B-spline surface patch cannot be tessellated watertight**. Our *own*
B-spline faces mesh (they are bare-periodic `VERTEX_LOOP` faces from revolution/extrude);
a *foreign* B-spline patch has trimmed `EDGE_LOOP` bounds with pcurves the native mesher does
not handle. This single gap sits under **freeform booleans, freeform blends, freeform
wrap-emboss, AND foreign STEP import**. It is stage **M0** — the keystone — and unblocks the
most downstream work per unit effort.

## Stages (dependency order)

Effort is given as **first robust slice** → *the honest bounded target*; the two asymptotic
stages (M6, and the tail of M5) never fully close.

### M0 — Freeform surface meshing + trimming (the keystone) · ~1.5–3 py
A native tessellator path for a **general trimmed B-spline/NURBS face**: pcurve-bounded
`EDGE_LOOP` trimming, watertight edge-shared meshing of a rational/non-rational patch, and
the pole/degeneracy handling already proven for revolution surfaces generalised to arbitrary
patches. **Unblocks M1, M2, M3, and foreign-B-spline STEP import (M4).**
- *Oracle:* `BRepMesh_IncrementalMesh` watertightness + area/volume of the meshed solid;
  the foreign-rational-B-spline STEP fixture that currently declines (M0 is exactly the gap
  that decline exposed).
- *Bounded.* This is hard but finite: a trimmed-NURBS mesher is well-understood engineering.
- **Status — narrow slice LANDED (mesher keystone).** The interior-sampling gap the foreign
  patch hit is closed: a genuinely-trimmed curved free-form face (Bézier/B-spline, rational or
  not, with an `EDGE_LOOP` outer bound and inner holes) now meshes with its INTERIOR sampled —
  a constrained-Delaunay triangulation (`uv_triangulate.h::ConstrainedDelaunay`) folds a
  curvature-driven interior grid into the shared-edge boundary and refines to the deflection
  bound. Previously such a face took the boundary-only ear-clip path, leaving the curved
  interior unresolved (chord deflection ≈ the whole bump height, unbounded — the decline the
  STEP foreign-rational-B-spline slice exposed). Proven host-side: a trimmed bump-cap face
  meshes ON the surface within the deflection bound; a cylinder capped by a trimmed free-form
  patch meshes WATERTIGHT with the closed-form volume, converging as deflection → 0
  (rel-vol 6.0 %→1.4 % as deflection halves). The change is STRICTLY ADDITIVE — a new arm in
  `face_mesher.h::mesh()` reached ONLY by a curved genuinely-trimmed free-form face; every
  existing surface kind's mesh is BYTE-IDENTICAL (triangle count / watertight / area / volume
  diffed against `main`), and the full host suite (29/29) + NUMSCI-ON pass. Whitespace: no
  tolerance weakened, no `cc_*` ABI change, tessellator otherwise pristine.
- **Deferred admission NOW LANDED (via M4).** The STEP READER ADMISSION of a foreign
  `B_SPLINE_SURFACE_WITH_KNOTS` face — a faithful curved-edge B-spline-surface pcurve arm in
  `step_reader.cpp` + a `S_face(pcurve(t)) = C_edge(t)` faithful-reconstruction guard (decline →
  OCCT on any unfaithful edge) — shipped in **M4** and its rational sibling in **M4-rational**,
  verified vs OCCT `STEPControl_Reader` + `BRepMesh` on the simulator (STEP import parity 83/83).
  The guard tolerance coincides with the mesher's weld snap radius (`kSnapEps = 1e-6`), so passing
  the guard *guarantees* a watertight seam. So the M0 keystone is now complete end-to-end (mesher +
  admission); the last B-spline import residual — a foreign rational-*curve* trim/edge boundary —
  now imports native too (M4-tail-2, combined `RATIONAL_B_SPLINE_CURVE` edge geometry, verified vs
  OCCT `STEPControl_Reader`, SIM parity 90/90). The remaining import tail is AP242 PMI semantics +
  `MAPPED_ITEM` (Form-B) assemblies.

### M1 — General freeform surface–surface intersection robustness (SSI S4 general) · ~2–5 py
Extend the SSI marcher (S1–S5 + S4-a…e already native) to the **general/freeform** degeneracy
regimes still deferred: general/freeform branch points (S4-d beyond Steinmetz), general
near-tangent (S4-c breadth), coincident/overlapping freeform surfaces, and self-intersection
resolution. The curve *pipeline* exists; this is the *robustness* on adversarial freeform input
— OCCT's decades-deep `IntPatch`/`IntWalk` tuning, re-earned incrementally.
- *Oracle:* `GeomAPI_IntSS` / `IntPatch` curve match (onSurf, arc length, branch/loop counts).
- *Partly asymptotic* — ships as progressively hardened slices; whatever is not robust defers.
- **Status — first slice LANDED (freeform S4-d open-arm branch point).** The first FREEFORM
  branch point traced to completion, beyond the analytic Steinmetz case: a bicubic B-spline saddle
  tangent to a plane through its saddle point self-crosses at one branch point whose four arms
  radiate OPEN to the finite patch boundary (unlike Steinmetz's CLOSED branch-to-branch arcs).
  `reclassifyBranchArcs` recognised only the closed topology (both arc ends on a branch node);
  it is generalised with an OPEN-ARM rule (one end on a branch node, the other on the boundary).
  Verified native-vs-OCCT (`run-sim-native-ssi-marching` 12/12): `saddle s4d-g` traced=4 arms,
  onCurve 8.9e-08 / onSurf 5.1e-10, matching OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS`'s 4 locus branches; a
  definite-contact B-spline bump honestly ends with no arms; all 11 prior controls frozen.
  STRICTLY ADDITIVE (`ssi/marching` only, +244/-11). The change proposal's own remedy —
  Richardson bias-cancellation of `relativeSecondForm` — was empirically REFUTED in diagnosis
  (central difference is already O(δ²)) and NOT shipped (no dead code). REMAINING (asymptotic
  tail): general near-tangent breadth, coincident/overlapping freeform, self-intersection.
- **Breadth attempt (M1-breadth) DECLINED — with a sharpened next-blocker.** A second freeform
  regime was attempted and honestly declined; no code shipped (`src/native` byte-identical). The
  diagnosis empirically refuted its own scoped pick (S4-f self-intersection *resolution*): on every
  Gerono-lemniscate fixture the marcher actually produces, it traces ONE lobe only (or laps the whole
  figure-eight ~2×, ~27 near-origin passes) — so no single clean transverse self-crossing exists to
  partition; a resolution pass would be defer-only dead code or forced fabrication. **The real
  blocker is upstream: marcher COMPLETENESS/dedup at the self-crossing** (trace both lobes exactly
  once, cross the origin transversally once) — that must land *before* any sub-arc partition is
  meaningful. Of the other two regimes: S4-a coincident/overlapping freeform is the only one with a
  clean *native* result (`detectOverlap` lands `OverlapSubRegion`, 0 undecided) but its decisive
  `IsDone=false`/`TheSame` OCCT oracle is only checkable on the sim (not at diagnose); S4-c general
  near-tangent stays the hard moat core.
- **M1-tail completeness attempt (M1-c) DECLINED — and CORRECTED the direction above (a theoretical
  result).** The "marcher self-crossing completeness (both lobes once + single *transverse* origin
  crossing, `branchPoints==0`)" slice was attempted and proven **geometrically self-contradictory**,
  so it is not the M1-tail's next slice after all. Two measured findings, no code shipped
  (`src/native` byte-identical, controls frozen — marching 14/14, S4-f 6/6): (1) **Analytic proof** —
  for a plane `z=0` ∩ graph `z=g(x,y)`, a self-crossing needs `g=0 ∧ ∇g=0`, and THERE the normals are
  parallel (`nB ∝ (−gₓ,−g_y,1) = (0,0,1) = nA` ⟹ `‖nA×nB‖=0`) — so **every such self-crossing is a
  tangent-degenerate S4-d BRANCH POINT, never a `branchPoints==0` transverse crossing**. (2) The
  canonical Gerono B-spline can't represent the sharp origin saddle (`z(0,0)=+9.7e-4`, rounded
  upward) — the locus is actually **two DISJOINT loops** (~0.05 gap), not a figure-eight, and the old
  `selfIntersections==1` was a false-positive proximity flag on a single pinched loop. **Corrected
  direction:** both-lobe coverage is reachable NOT via a `branchPoints==0` completeness pass but via
  either (a) the *existing* S4-d `enableBranchPoints` path on an exact/denser fixture (already yields
  both lobes, arc 6.27, `branchPoints=1`) or (b) a **seeder-dedup** fix so each disjoint spline lobe
  gets a seed → two `Closed` loops. The M1-tail's real next slice is one of those (seeding / branch-
  routing), not self-crossing completeness.
- **M1b analytic-quadric breadth LANDED (verified vs OCCT, test+spec only) — and RE-SCOPED the
  skew-cyl "NotAnalytic" decline.** The roadmap's recorded `skew cylinder∩cylinder = NotAnalytic`
  decline was found to be **S1-closed-form-only**: the S1 conic dispatch (`quadric_pairs.h`)
  correctly has no closed form for the quartic, but the **S2 seeder + S3 marcher already trace the
  general poses** (host-probed: skew cyl∩cyl gap+oblique, sphere∩cone off-axis, and more all trace
  with `nearTangentGaps==0` and on-both-surfaces ≈ 1e-11). The gap was verification/regression
  coverage, not tracer capability. This slice locks two general non-coaxial analytic-quadric
  families as **verified, regression-covered breadth**, both gates green, `src/native` byte-identical
  (change `moat-m1b-ssi-breadth`, diff confined to `test_native_ssi_marching.cpp` +
  `native_ssi_marching_parity.mm`):
  - **general skew cyl∩cyl → single connected quartic loop** (axes with a nonzero min-distance gap
    AND 60° oblique tilt; distinct from the existing symmetric orthogonal-intersecting two-loop
    case). Gate B vs `GeomAPI_IntSS`: 1/1 branch, closed 1/1, onCurve 9.4e-5, onSurf 5.2e-5,
    lenDelta 2.7e-6 (nat 10.1611 / occt 10.1612).
  - **off-axis sphere∩cone → single loop** (finite sphere admits the near cone nappe once). Gate B:
    1/1, closed 1/1, onCurve 3.4e-5, onSurf 1.2e-5, lenDelta 1.8e-6 (nat 7.2619 / occt 7.2620).
  - Host Gate A 16/16; sim Gate B **14/0** (12 prior cases frozen + 2 new). S1 `NotAnalytic`
    assertions unchanged (`test_native_ssi.cpp` 11/11).
  - **Honestly DECLINED tail (sharpened next blocker):** general cone∩cone, off-axis cyl∩cone, and
    off-axis sphere∩cyl. Root cause is a MEASURED oracle-setup mismatch: OCCT
    `Geom_ConicalSurface`/`Geom_CylindricalSurface` are **infinite** (both nappes / unbounded
    height) while the native adapters are **finite patches**, so when an unbounded quadric pierces
    the other operand more than once along its infinite extent the oracle returns a multi-loop locus
    (cyl∩cone off-axis arc-length ≈ 66; cone∩cone 2 nappe-components; off-axis sphere∩cyl 2 loops)
    that the finite native trace cannot match — AND the second loop is a **seeding-recall** miss at
    practical seed densities (off-axis sphere∩cyl needs 16×16 to catch both). The next slice is
    **domain-clipped oracle surfaces** (`Geom_RectangularTrimmedSurface` to the native patch bounds)
    + a **seeding-recall** bump, which would promote the declined tail to verified.
- **M1c off-axis quadric TAIL PROMOTED to verified — the M1b-declined tail is now green (change
  `moat-m1c-ssi-tail`).** The two named fixes landed:
  1. **Domain-clipped oracle** (harness-only): the sim parity gate wraps each infinite OCCT quadric
     in a `Geom_RectangularTrimmedSurface` trimmed to the native adapter's finite `ParamBox`
     (`clipOracle`), so `GeomAPI_IntSS` returns the SAME finite locus the native trace covers — an
     apples-to-apples oracle. `src/native` untouched by this fix.
  2. **Targeted seeding-recall bump** (`src/native/ssi/`, additive, default-off):
     `SeedOptions::criticTargetedReseed` (+ `criticMaxCells`) makes the S4-f completeness critic
     re-seed ONLY the uncovered param cells (each uncovered A-cell as a restricted sub-domain vs B's
     full domain), recovering the SECOND loop of a twice-piercing pose that the coarse grid merges
     into one topological cluster. ROOT CAUSE was measured: at grids 4/6/8 the two disjoint loops
     merge into ONE union-find cluster (`numClusters==1`, `refinedAccepted==1`) → one representative
     seed; the LM refine converges to BOTH loops from coarse starts (so not a refine miss) and the
     candidates exist (so not a subdivision miss). A seeder-only 3D-proximity clustering guard was
     tried and REJECTED (the coarse leaf boxes 3D-bridge the loops, and a fixed radius over-splits a
     single large loop) — the correct disambiguator needs the traced curve, which the critic's
     locus dedup provides. Both flags DEFAULT OFF → the fixed seeder and the shipped whole-domain
     critic are byte-identical for every prior case.
  - **Promoted families (both gates green):** general **cone∩cone** (offset apexes + tilted axes →
    1 closed loop), off-axis **cyl∩cone** (1 open BoundaryExit arc), off-axis **sphere∩cyl
    twice-piercing** (2 disjoint closed loops; the recall bump recovers the second).
  - Host **Gate A 19/19** (self-consistency: every node on both surfaces ≤ 1e-9; the twice-piercing
    case asserts baseline=1 loop → bump=2 closed loops, `criticRecoveredLoops≥1`). Sim **Gate B
    17/0** vs the domain-clipped `GeomAPI_IntSS`: cone cone general 1/1 closed 1/1 onCurve 3.9e-6
    onSurf 3.4e-6 lenDelta 3.3e-6; cyl cone off-axis 1/1 closed 0/0 onCurve 4.7e-7 onSurf 4.3e-7
    lenDelta 7.9e-5; sphere cyl twice 2/2 closed 2/2 onCurve 7.6e-7 onSurf 4.4e-7 lenDelta 7.0e-6;
    all 14 prior cases frozen. S1 `NotAnalytic` assertions unchanged; no tolerance weakened.
  - **Next blocker (sharpened):** the remaining SSI moat core is S4-c general near-tangent breadth
    (grazing crossings where the transversality sine dips below the crossable band) and
    coincident/overlapping FREEFORM surfaces — both still defer to OCCT. The quadric-pair breadth is
    now verified end-to-end; the freeform near-tangent tail is the hard slice.

### M2 — General freeform booleans · ~2–4 py · needs M0 + M1
Lift `recogniseCurvedSolid` to accept **freeform (B-spline/NURBS) operands** (it rejects them
today — the S5 assembler is analytic-only), split freeform faces along the S3/M1-traced WLine,
classify + weld watertight (the M0 mesher). This is the general-curved-boolean payoff the
whole SSI arc was built for.
- *Oracle:* `BRepAlgoAPI_{Fuse,Cut,Common}` volume/area/watertight on NURBS↔NURBS and
  freeform↔analytic pairs.
- *Bounded per family, asymptotic in full generality* (arbitrary self-intersecting inputs).
- **Status — first-slice attempt DECLINED (honest, no code shipped).** The Wave-2 slice tried
  to lift `recogniseCurvedSolid` to admit ONE tractable freeform operand pair (freeform↔analytic,
  COMMON/CUT) and route it through split→classify→weld. It DID NOT land: the freeform boolean
  requires a from-scratch subsystem whose entry points do not yet exist, and no half-built dead
  code was left behind (working tree clean, `src/native` byte-identical, `src/native/**`
  OCCT-free). The measured blockers, confirmed in source at
  `src/native/boolean/ssi_boolean.h`:
  - **B1 — recognition rejects freeform.** `recogniseCurvedSolid` (line 200)
    `default: return std::nullopt; // BSpline / Bezier → freeform → OCCT` — only
    Cylinder/Sphere/Cone surfaces are admitted; any B-spline/NURBS face declines before any
    trace runs. The S5 assembler is analytic-only.
  - **B2 — no freeform face split.** There is no path to split a trimmed freeform face along the
    S3/M1-traced WLine into in/out sub-faces (only analytic caps/walls are assembled).
  - **B3 — no freeform point-in-solid.** `classifyPoint` (line 247) evaluates only the analytic
    `CurvedSolid` wall (cylinder/sphere/cone radial/spherical/conic half-space + planar caps);
    it has no point-in-freeform-solid classifier, so in/out labelling of split fragments is
    unavailable for a freeform operand.
  - **B4/B5 — no freeform weld/assembly.** ✅ **RESOLVED (B4 landed):** `boolean/half_space_cut.h`
    splits each analytic face the cut plane crosses, synthesises the cross-section cap from the B2
    seam spliced to the analytic-face crossing chords, welds the survivors through the M0 mesher,
    and runs the mandatory watertight self-verify — composing the first freeform↔analytic CUT. The
    **B2 smooth-trim (closed/circular wall) generalisation ✅ LANDED** (`boolean/smooth_trim_split.h`
    `splitFaceSmoothTrim`, host gate 7/7 — see the M2 row); the remaining enabler is the curved-wall
    half-space WELD that consumes it.
  Both mandatory gates remain **green with zero regression**: host-analytic native suites pass
  (incl. `freeform_bspline_face_operand_declines_before_trace`, which directly exercises B1), and
  the sim native-vs-OCCT run is `24 passed / 0 failed / 6 fell-back (native-pass=18)` — the 6
  fall-backs are exactly the `sphere×box` and `cone×box` freeform/box families across all three
  ops, each logging `recogniseCurvedSolid … gate declines → native NULL → OCCT`. No wrong or leaky
  result is ever emitted: freeform operands honestly self-decline to the OCCT oracle. This is a
  first-class HONEST DECLINE for a research-grade stage; the B1–B5 subsystem is bounded per surface
  family and remains the next critical-path target. No OpenSpec change was archived (nothing landed);
  this roadmap entry is the tracker for the measured blocker.
- **M2 substrate — B1/B2/B3 broken out as parallelizable tracks (start NOW).** The decline is not
  "M2 is hard" — it is three *nameable, bounded* subsystems the analytic S5 assembler never needed.
  Each operates on the EXISTING native topology (`shape.h` trimmed-B-spline `FaceSurface` + `PCurve`)
  plus a landed enabler, and each has its OWN standalone OCCT oracle — so **B2 and B3 can be built
  and verified concurrently right now, independent of each other and of B1**:

  | Track | Subsystem | Module | Needs (all landed) | Standalone OCCT oracle | Start now? |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | **M2b (B2)** | WLine freeform face-split — partition a trimmed freeform face's uv domain along the M1 seam pcurve into in/out sub-faces | `boolean/` (+ `ssi/`) | M1 WLine (`WLinePoint` carries `(u1,v1)`/`(u2,v2)` per node) ✓, `shape.h` faces | sub-faces tile the original + each meshes watertight via the M0 mesher | **YES — parallel** |
  | **M2c (B3)** | Freeform point-in-solid membership — ray-cast / winding against the M0-meshed trimmed faces | `boolean/` | M0 mesher ✓, `shape.h` faces | `BRepClass3d_SolidClassifier` (per-point in/out) | **YES — parallel** |
  | **M2a (B1)** | Freeform operand descriptor + recogniser — the data model B2/B3 plug into (additive sibling of `recogniseCurvedSolid`) | `boolean/` | `shape.h` | host gate: admit + round-trip + decline battery (assembly vs OCCT once a B4 weld verb exists) | ✅ **LANDED** — `freeform_operand.h` |

  Sequencing: **M2b ∥ M2c now** (two isolated tracks, disjoint algorithms, each self-verifiable);
  **M2a** is the small integration layer, best sized once B2/B3 fix their interfaces. Then
  **M2 = M2a ∘ M2b ∘ M2c** (recognise → trace [M1] → split [B2] → classify [B3] → weld [M0]) — the
  assembly is what turns three green subsystems into the first freeform boolean. The live critical
  path refines to **[B2 ∥ B3] → B1 → M2 → M3**.

  **M2c (B3) — first slice LANDED (this change).** `src/native/boolean/freeform_membership.h`
  (header-only, OCCT-free, cognitive-complexity ≤ 12 per function): isolated Möller–Trumbore and
  exact point-triangle-distance kernels, and `classifyPointInMesh(mesh, bbox, meshDeflection, p,
  tol) → {In,Out,On,Unknown}`. Odd/even crossing parity over a fixed 7-ray non-axis set with
  degenerate-ray discard + unanimity/quorum consensus; a principled ON-band
  `max(absTol, relTol·diag) + 2·meshDeflection` (the measured chord-secant mesh inset); watertight
  precondition ⇒ `Unknown` (never a fabricated verdict). Strictly ADDITIVE — `classifyPoint`/
  `recogniseCurvedSolid` and the whole tessellator are byte-identical vs `main`; no `cc_*` ABI change.
  - **Gate A (HOST ANALYTIC, no OCCT)** — `tests/native/test_native_freeform_membership.cpp`.
    Fixture: the M0 keystone `bumpCappedCylinderSolid` (Bézier paraboloid "bump cap" top wall,
    closed-form membership), meshed watertight at deflection 0.02. Away-from-band batch (3000 pts,
    clearance > 3·band): **agree 3000 / WRONG 0 / declined 0**. On-surface samples all resolve `On`.
    Full 40 000-pt random batch: **crispWRONG 0** (the load-bearing no-silent-wrong invariant).
  - **Gate B (SIM native-vs-OCCT)** — `tests/sim/native_freeform_membership_parity.mm` (runner
    `scripts/run-sim-native-freeform-membership.sh`). Bridged NURBS solids (all faces
    `Geom_BSplineSurface`) meshed with M0, classified vs `BRepClass3d_SolidClassifier`.
    `nurbs_box` (watertight): **N=3000, crispAgree 2933, crispDISAGREE 0**, in-band/declined 67 → GATE PASS.
    `nurbs_cylinder` (curved): an **honest R1 decline** — the bridged-freeform M0 mesh is non-watertight
    (measured 273 open edges: the periodic BSpline seam edge does not weld), so the classifier declines
    to `Unknown` rather than fabricate. This is the asymptotic curved-bridged tail, not a classifier
    defect (the curved case is proven crisp-correct against analytic truth in Gate A).

  **M2a (B1) — descriptor + gate LANDED; end-to-end assembly HONEST-DECLINED (this change).**
  `src/native/boolean/freeform_operand.h` (header-only, OCCT-free, backend-band): the
  `FreeformOperand`/`OperandFace`/`FaceRole` value descriptor + `recogniseFreeformSolid(Shape,
  OperandDecline*) → optional<FreeformOperand>`, a strictly ADDITIVE SIBLING to the analytic
  `recogniseCurvedSolid` (which — with `classifyPoint`, M0, M1, B2, B3 — is byte-identical vs the
  landed tree; no `cc_*` ABI change; 0 OCCT includes under `src/native/**`). The gate admits ONE
  reachable operand — a non-null single-shell `Solid` with ≥1 genuinely-trimmed BSpline/Bezier wall
  + only admissible analytic caps (plane/cylinder/sphere/cone), closed as a 2-manifold (every
  undirected edge, keyed by endpoint-vertex identity, used by exactly two face incidences) — and
  exposes exactly the M2 verbs' handles: the freeform `Face` (→ B2 `splitFace`), the operand `Shape`
  (→ M0 `SolidMesher::mesh`), the world `Aabb` (→ B3 `classifyPointInMesh`). Every other operand
  returns `nullopt` with a measured `OperandDecline` (NotSolid / MultiShell / FaceSurfaceMissing /
  UnsupportedSurfaceKind / BareFreeformFace / HoledFreeformFace / NoFreeformFace / NotWatertight) —
  a first-class honest decline, no weakened tolerance.
  - **Gate A (HOST ANALYTIC, no OCCT)** — `tests/native/test_native_freeform_operand.cpp`
    (14/14 pass). On the M0 keystone `bumpCappedCylinder` (cylinder side + planar bottom + Bézier
    bump cap): ADMITTED; 3 faces role-tagged (1 freeform + 2 analytic); the freeform surface/kind
    round-trips bit-identically; `outwardN` materially outward on every face; `bbox` tight
    (x,y ∈ [−R,R], z ∈ [0,h], diagonal usable); `watertight` true. Full decline battery green
    (each blocker measured). Exposed handles proven: the `Shape` meshes watertight under M0; the
    descriptor `Aabb` scales B3 (interior→In, exterior→Out).
  - **Assembly HONEST DECLINE (measured blocker).** The stretch — the minimal end-to-end
    freeform↔analytic CUT/COMMON composing only the four landed verbs (recognise → M1 trace → B2
    split → B3 classify → M0 weld) — is **not robustly reachable**, so B1 lands ALONE (an accepted,
    expected outcome). Two independent, measured blockers: **(i)** the sole freeform wall of the
    reachable freeform-SOLID class carries a smooth CLOSED (circular) trim, but B2 `splitFace`'s
    first slice requires a convex straight-edged outer loop (≥3 boundary segments) — it returns
    `NoOuterLoop` (measured in the gate). **(ii)** even a polygon-trimmed freeform wall does not
    close the boolean: a half-space cutting a closed solid also crosses its ANALYTIC cap/side faces
    (needing an analytic-face splitter) and synthesizes a NEW cross-section cap on the cutting plane
    — neither an analytic-face split nor a cap synthesizer is among the four landed M2 verbs (B2 is
    freeform-only). No stub/dead `freeform_boolean_solid` was written; the engine keeps its OCCT
    fall-through. Closing the gap needs a B2 convex→smooth-trim generalisation **and** a B4 analytic-
    face split + cross-section cap synthesis (the M2 weld/assembly verb), tracked next.

### M3 — General freeform blends + wrap-emboss · ~2–4 py · needs M2
The curved-curved blends and freeform-base features that sit on booleans: cyl↔cyl-canal /
elliptical-crease / variable-on-freeform fillets, general chamfers, and wrap-emboss on a
sphere/cone/freeform base (all declined this session for lack of M0/M2). General canal-surface
construction + the M0 mesher + M2 booleans.
- *Oracle:* `BRepFilletAPI` / `BRepOffsetAPI` / `cc_wrap_emboss` (volume/area/watertight/continuity).
- **Status — analytic FACE-fillet slice LANDED (`moat-m3af-analytic-fillet`).** The
  **prismatic full-round** — `cc_full_round_fillet[_faces]` on a rib between two PARALLEL
  planar walls — is now NATIVE: a tangent half-cylinder cap of radius r = strip-width/2,
  built as the r = w/2 special case of the landed rolling-ball blend on the two OPPOSITE
  seam edges (`src/native/blend/full_round.h`), consuming the middle face. Both gates
  green — host analytic `V_removed = (w²/2)(1−π/4)·L` + SIM parity vs the OCCT full-round
  oracle (watertight, χ=2, vol/area/bbox/deflection-bounded-Hausdorff).
- **Status — SPHERICAL FILLET-CORNER weld LANDED (`moat-fcw-fillet-corner-weld`) → full-face
  fillets NATIVE.** `cc_fillet_face` now LANDS on a planar PRISM CAP:
  `src/native/blend/fillet_corner.h` rounds every convex edge bounding a picked planar
  face, welding the per-edge tangent-cylinder strips together with a **spherical corner
  patch** (sphere radius r centred at the trihedral offset point) + a flat corner ledge
  at each shared corner. The curved↔curved weld is EXACT because the sphere centre lies
  on BOTH incident cylinder axes, so the cylinder strip end arc and the sphere leg are the
  SAME great-circle arc — sampled by ONE canonical `arcSample` (slerp) consumed
  bit-identically by both faces, so the seam welds watertight at ANY deflection PURELY in
  the assembly layer (**NO tessellator change** — the byte-identical gate is trivially met,
  zero mesher diff). Both gates green: host analytic `V_removed = r²L(4−π) − 4r³ + (4/3)π r³`
  (converges as deflection refines; watertight + `isConsistentlyOriented` at every
  deflection) + SIM parity vs OCCT `BRepFilletAPI_MakeFillet` (watertight, χ=2, volume rel
  <5e-3 / analytic <1e-3, area <2e-2, bbox exact). SCOPE (honest): the incident side walls
  must be PERPENDICULAR to the face (prism cap — the ledge is then planar); a
  non-perpendicular wall / concave / curved / ≠2-face edge / oversized radius / self-verify
  miss DECLINES → OCCT. OCCT's setback-corner shape differs from the pure sphere-octant by
  ~r locally (a modeling-convention gap, like the chamfer triple-corner) — reported, not
  gated; the native volume is actually CLOSER to the ideal closed form than OCCT's. The
  DIHEDRAL / curved / closed-seam full round still declines → OCCT (dihedral valley-solve +
  closed-seam weld gate on M2). Residual = the freeform/curved-blend breadth above.

### M4 — General STEP / AP242 import (+ IGES stays dropped) · ~1.5–3 py · needs M0
The remaining import breadth on the landed AP203+ reader: **foreign rational/general B-spline
patches** (needs M0 to mesh them), AP242 **PMI semantics** (not just skip), general **trimmed
surfaces**. **DEEP-NESTED (multi-level) rigid/conformal assemblies now LAND** (M4-tail): the
Form-A CDSR relationship graph is modelled as a parent-edge forest over shape-representations
and each leaf composes its full world placement `W = T_root ∘ … ∘ T_leaf` via a leaf→root
chain walk (single-level is the length-1 special case, byte-identical). **`MAPPED_ITEM` /
`REPRESENTATION_MAP` (Form-B) assembly INSTANCING now LANDS too** (M4-tail, `moat-m4t-assembly-import`):
the standard AP242 assembly-reuse mechanism — a `REPRESENTATION_MAP` over a shared brep, instanced by
N `MAPPED_ITEM`s each at `T = frameToWorld(target) ∘ frameToWorld(origin)⁻¹` (AXIS2 target) or a
`CARTESIAN_TRANSFORMATION_OPERATOR_3D` (scale/mirror), reusing the SAME `classifyPlacement` /
`Shape::located` substrate as Form-A; the shared brep is mapped ONCE and re-instanced through the shared
node → a placed Compound (GATE a host-analytic + GATE b SIM parity vs `STEPControl_Reader`, both green).
A mapped rep reaching ≠1 brep, a non-conformal target, a lone `REPRESENTATION_MAP`, or a MIXED Form-A+B
file still honestly DECLINE → OCCT, as do cyclic / ambiguous-shared / non-conformal Form-A graphs. **PMI
SEMANTICS remain the deferred tail** (honest DECLINE — only the read-only `pmi_scan` census recognises
GD&T/tolerance/datum entities; no tolerance-zone / feature-control-frame / datum-reference-frame model is
built). IGES is **descoped** (STEP-only; `cc_iges_*`
stays OCCT until removed/stubbed at drop-occt — never reimplemented).
- *Oracle:* `STEPControl_Reader` re-import (count/volume/watertight/topology) + foreign files.
- *Bounded* (mechanical parser breadth, once M0 meshes the surfaces).

### M5 — Shape-healing robustness · ~2–4 py + asymptotic tail · gates M4 quality
Beyond the landed first slice (tolerant sew + vertex/tolerance unify + degenerate removal +
orientation): **pcurve reconstruction, self-intersecting-wire repair, beyond-tolerance gap
bridging, arbitrary broken industrial B-rep**. Gates trustworthy foreign import (M4) and any
`drop-occt` decision.
- *Oracle:* `ShapeFix_*` / `BRepBuilderAPI_Sewing` on broken fixtures + real foreign files.
- **Asymptotic** — a first robust slice is bounded; the completeness against arbitrary broken
  input is the decades-deep `ShapeFix` moat, re-earned only incrementally.
- **Status — first slice LANDED (opt-in beyond-tolerance gap bridging).** Beyond the landed
  sew/unify/orientation healer, a near-miss seam gap slightly ABOVE the weld tolerance — which the
  healer DECLINES — now bridges to a watertight solid. `gap_bridge.h` (new, header-only, OCCT-free)
  snaps the primary weld's unpaired boundary corners onto their cross-face partner within the
  BOUNDED band `(tolerance, min(budget, ¼·shortestIncidentEdge)]` (a hard local-feature cap so it
  never collapses a real feature), then re-sews. Opt-in (`gapBridgeBudget=0` default OFF, existing
  healer BYTE-IDENTICAL); NEVER widens the weld tolerance. Verified native-vs-OCCT
  (`run-sim-native-heal` 6/6): a bridged seam heals V=1.000 (4 corners) matching OCCT `Sewing`
  (V=1.00167); an out-of-budget gap declines honestly (`GapBeyondBudget`); the 4 landed controls
  frozen.
- **Status — tail slice LANDED (opt-in single planar-hole cap).** Beyond the sew/unify/orientation +
  gap-bridging healer, a shell that sews cleanly but is simply MISSING one face — which the healer
  DECLINES as `OpenShell` — now closes to a watertight solid. `cap_hole.h` (new, header-only,
  OCCT-free) reconstructs the surviving boundary edges from the sewn shared nodes, and when they form
  EXACTLY ONE simple cycle that is coplanar within `tolerance` and a simple polygon, synthesizes ONE
  cap face on those existing shared nodes and re-sews; the UNCHANGED mandatory self-verify then proves
  watertight + positive volume. Opt-in (`capPlanarHoles=false` default OFF, existing healer
  BYTE-IDENTICAL); NEVER weakens the weld tolerance; no new `UnhealedReason`. Verified both gates:
  host analytic (capped cube V=1.0, no OCCT; two-hole and non-planar holes decline; default-off no-op)
  and native-vs-OCCT (`run-sim-native-heal` 8/8) — the cap matches an OCCT reference cap
  (`BRepBuilderAPI_MakeFace(gp_Pln, freeBoundaryWire)` + `ShapeFix`) at V=1.0, and a two-hole shell
  declines matching OCCT leaving it open. EMPIRICAL NOTE: OCCT's `MakeFace(gp_Pln, wire)` tolerates a
  mildly-non-planar wire (keeps 3D vertices) and caps it, so native declining a non-planar hole is
  native being MORE conservative and DEFERRING to OCCT — not a shared decline. REMAINING (asymptotic
  tail): pcurve reconstruction, self-intersecting-wire repair, non-planar / curved missing-face
  synthesis, arbitrary broken industrial B-rep.
- **Status — tail slice LANDED (opt-in MULTI planar-hole cap).** Strict superset of the single
  planar-hole cap: a shell MISSING two or more faces — which the healer DECLINES — now closes when
  EVERY surviving boundary ring is a disjoint simple cycle, coplanar within `tolerance`, and a
  simple polygon. `cap_hole.h` adds `traceAllLoops` (all disjoint degree-2 boundary cycles) +
  `capAllPlanarHoles`, reusing the IDENTICAL best-fit-plane / planarity / simple-polygon layers per
  ring; the landed single-hole `traceSingleLoop` / `capPlanarHole` are BYTE-IDENTICAL. ALL-OR-NOTHING:
  if any ring branches, is non-planar, or self-intersects, the WHOLE set is declined (no partial
  closure), and the UNCHANGED mandatory self-verify remains authoritative. Opt-in
  (`capMultiplePlanarHoles=false` default OFF; when false the single-hole path runs unchanged so every
  existing caller is byte-identical); NEVER weakens the weld tolerance; no new `UnhealedReason`.
  Verified both gates: host analytic (`test_native_heal` 23/23 — cube missing two OPPOSITE faces caps
  to V=1.0 with nCappedFaces=2; mixed-planarity two-hole set declines the WHOLE set; two ADJACENT
  missing faces orphan the shared corners → `GapBeyondTolerance` decline; the reused simple-polygon
  layer rejects a bowtie; default-off byte-identical) and native-vs-OCCT (`run-sim-native-heal` 10/10
  — the two caps match an OCCT reference `BRepBuilderAPI_MakeFace(gp_Pln, wire)` ×2 + `ShapeFix` at
  V=1.0, and the two-adjacent case declines matching OCCT leaving it open). REMAINING (asymptotic
  tail): pcurve reconstruction, self-intersecting-wire repair, non-planar / curved missing-face
  synthesis, arbitrary broken industrial B-rep.
- **Status — tail slice LANDED (opt-in SHORT-EDGE merge).** Beyond the sew/unify/orientation +
  bridging + capping healer, a shell whose boundary carries a spurious SHORT (sub-feature) edge —
  a boundary vertex a STEP exporter / mesh→B-rep conversion split into a tiny NON-zero edge on an
  otherwise-straight wire run, above the weld `tol` (so `dropZeroLengthSides` leaves it) but whose
  interior split vertex the neighbour face does not carry (so the sew cannot share the run and the
  healer DECLINES) — now heals. `short_edge.h` (new, header-only, OCCT-free) removes a REDUNDANT
  COLLINEAR short edge B→C (wire neighbours A,D) when it lies in the bounded band
  `(tol, min(shortEdgeMergeLen, ¼·min(|A−B|,|C−D|))]` AND both endpoints lie within `tol` of the
  straight line A→D, dropping BOTH endpoints to restore the exact span A→D the neighbour already
  carries, then re-sews; the UNCHANGED mandatory self-verify proves watertight + positive volume.
  Distinct from the landed passes: `dropZeroLengthSides` removes only ≤tol consecutive corners;
  `gap_bridge` snaps only CROSS-FACE seam corners (this is WITHIN one face). Opt-in
  (`shortEdgeMergeLen=0` default OFF, existing healer BYTE-IDENTICAL); NEVER widens the weld
  tolerance; no new `UnhealedReason`; a short edge that turns a REAL (non-collinear) corner is left
  in place. Verified both gates: host analytic (`test_native_heal` 28/28 — split cube collapses to
  V=1.0 with nCollapsedShortEdges=1; default-off declines `GapBeyondTolerance` residual=seg with
  input unchanged; the ¼·neighbour feature cap refuses a large merge length; a non-collinear notch
  is kept; the `collapseLoop` layer unit-driven) and native-vs-OCCT (`run-sim-native-heal` 12/12 —
  the collapse matches OCCT `Sewing`@(tol≥seg)+`ShapeFix` at V=1.0; with the flag OFF native declines
  while OCCT aggressively closes the collinear split → native is EQUAL-OR-MORE-CONSERVATIVE, OCCT's
  closure the same honest unit cube, so deferring costs no correctness). REMAINING (asymptotic tail):
  a short edge that turns a real corner, a collapse needing the neighbour face re-projected, pcurve
  reconstruction, self-intersecting-wire repair, arbitrary broken industrial B-rep.
- **Status — tail slice LANDED (opt-in COLLINEAR-VERTEX removal).** Beyond the sew/unify/orientation +
  bridging + capping + short-edge healer, a shell whose boundary carries a single REDUNDANT COLLINEAR
  vertex — the classic STEP "T-vertex" / seam-split: an exporter drops an extra vertex B onto a face's
  straight run A→C (the face lists A→B→C, two edges) while the NEIGHBOUR carries the same span as ONE
  straight edge A→C, so the sew cannot share the run and the healer DECLINES — now heals. `collinear_vert.h`
  (new, header-only, OCCT-free) removes B when its perpendicular distance to line A→C is ≤ `tol` AND it
  projects strictly between A and C (0<t<1, so a backtracking spur is never removed), restoring the exact
  span A→C the neighbour already carries, then re-sews; the UNCHANGED mandatory self-verify proves
  watertight + positive volume. Distinct from `short_edge.h`: BOTH incident edges may be FULL-LENGTH (no
  ¼·neighbour micro-edge bound; a SINGLE corner removed, not two), so `collapseLoop`'s length band cannot
  reach it. Introduces NO length parameter — exact collinearity is the sole criterion. Opt-in
  (`removeCollinearVerts=false` default OFF, existing healer BYTE-IDENTICAL); NEVER widens the weld
  tolerance; no new `UnhealedReason`; a vertex that turns a REAL (non-collinear) corner is left in place.
  Verified both gates: host analytic (`test_native_heal` 32/32 — cube with a collinear T-vertex at t=0.3
  heals to V=1.0 with nRemovedCollinearVerts=1 and nCollapsedShortEdges=0; default-off declines
  `GapBeyondTolerance` residual=0.3 with input unchanged; a 0.1-off-line real corner is kept; the
  `removeLoopVerts` layer unit-driven incl. the backtracking-spur refusal) and native-vs-OCCT
  (`run-sim-native-heal` 14/14 — the removal matches OCCT `Sewing`+`ShapeFix` at V=1.0; with the flag OFF
  native declines while OCCT aggressively drops the collinear vertex → native EQUAL-OR-MORE-CONSERVATIVE,
  OCCT's closure the same honest unit cube). REMAINING (asymptotic tail): a vertex that turns a real corner,
  a removal needing the neighbour face re-projected, pcurve reconstruction, self-intersecting-wire repair,
  arbitrary broken industrial B-rep.
- **Status — tail slice EXTENDED (multi-collinear RUN removal to a FIXPOINT).** The collinear-vertex pass
  removed only a SINGLE redundant vertex per straight span: its one disjoint left-to-right sweep skips past a
  removed vertex's successor, so a STEP "over-split" run A→B1→B2→…→C (one straight edge cut into three-or-more
  FULL-LENGTH sub-edges, every Bₖ on the line) lost only every OTHER vertex per pass and a survivor still
  blocked the sew → the healer DECLINED. `collinear_vert.h` now iterates the disjoint sweep
  (`detail::removeLoopVertsPass`) to a FIXPOINT inside `detail::removeLoopVerts`: it re-runs on the previous
  sweep's SURVIVORS until a sweep removes nothing (or the loop reaches a triangle), so once B1 is gone the next
  sweep sees B2's neighbours as A,C and removes it too — the whole run collapses to the single straight edge
  A→C. Termination is guaranteed (survivors strictly decrease while any removal occurs). No `HealOptions` /
  `HealMetrics` / `heal.cpp` change — internal to the helper; the single-vertex and default-OFF paths are
  BYTE-IDENTICAL (one sweep then terminate; no-op when disabled); `nRemovedCollinearVerts` now counts the whole
  run. Verified both gates: host analytic (`test_native_heal` 36/36 — a 2-vertex run t=0.3,0.6 heals to V=1.0
  with nRemovedCollinearVerts=2; a 3-vertex run t=0.25,0.5,0.75 → nRemovedCollinearVerts=3, exercising >1
  fixpoint iteration; default-off declines `GapBeyondTolerance` input unchanged; `removeLoopVerts` unit-driven
  collapses a 2-vertex run to a square while keeping an off-line real corner in a mixed run) and native-vs-OCCT
  (`run-sim-native-heal` 16/16 — the 2-run removal matches OCCT `Sewing`+`ShapeFix` at V=1.0, removed=2; flag OFF
  native declines while OCCT closes → native EQUAL-OR-MORE-CONSERVATIVE, OCCT's closure the same honest unit
  cube). REMAINING (asymptotic tail, unchanged): a vertex that turns a real corner, a removal needing the
  neighbour face re-projected, pcurve reconstruction, self-intersecting-wire repair, arbitrary broken
  industrial B-rep — no clean isolated closed-form/OCCT arbiter, the honest phase-end.

### M6 — Robustness completeness bar (S4-f + coverage) · ongoing · gates drop-occt
The measured-recall / completeness discipline (SSI S4-f landed a first slice): below any fixed
resolution a smaller intersection loop can be missed. Before OCCT can be *removed* (not just
defaulted), a **measured completeness bar** across the whole native surface — booleans, blends,
import, healing — must be met and continuously guarded (loop-until-dry critics, adversarial
fuzzing vs OCCT).
- *Oracle:* differential fuzzing — random valid inputs through both native and OCCT, assert
  agreement or an honest native decline; zero silent wrong results.
- **Asymptotic** — never "done"; this is the gate that keeps `drop-occt` a decision, not a date.
- **Status — first slice LANDED (curved-boolean differential fuzzer).** A DETERMINISTIC seeded
  generator drives random VALID operands from six recognised families (sphere∩sphere, cone∩sphere,
  cone∩cyl, Steinmetz, box∩cyl, drill) × {fuse,cut,common} through BOTH native and OCCT and
  classifies each trial AGREE / honest-native-DECLINE / DISAGREE. Two seeds, 512 trials:
  432 AGREED / 80 HONESTLY-DECLINED / **0 DISAGREED** — native genuinely exercised (real volumes
  matching OCCT, dV ~1e-3..1e-4), the fixed relTol=2e-2 NEVER widened. New
  `tests/sim/native_boolean_fuzz.mm` + `scripts/run-sim-native-boolean-fuzz.sh`; `src/native`
  untouched (pure test infra). The FIRST measured completeness signal beyond the hand-picked
  native-pass=18 fixtures.
- **Breadth — FIVE native domains now under the fuzzing bar.** (2nd) STEP round-trip
  `tests/sim/native_step_import_fuzz.mm` (0 DISAGREED; *surfaced* an OCCT reader inaccuracy on
  shallow frustums, native vindicated by closed-form). (3rd, this slice) **construction
  loft/sweep** `tests/sim/native_construct_fuzz.mm` + `scripts/run-sim-native-construct-fuzz.sh`:
  a DETERMINISTIC seeded generator (splitmix64→xoshiro256**, seeded ONLY by FUZZ_SEED) drives
  random VALID inputs from four native-claimed families — equal- AND mismatched-count planar
  N-section ruled loft (frustum / prismatoid-stack) and straight constant-frame sweep (prism) —
  through BOTH the OCCT-FREE `build_loft_sections`/`build_sweep` (measured by the native
  tessellator) AND the OCCT oracle (`BRepOffsetAPI_ThruSections`/`MakePipe`, measured by
  `BRepGProp`), plus sparse non-planar loft/sweep inputs to exercise the native NULL→OCCT
  DECLINE branch. Two seeds (0x5744EE9911 N=96 → 78/18/0; 0xDEADBEEFCAFE N=128 → 110/18/0):
  **0 DISAGREED**, every AGREE OCCT-exact (dV/dA ~1e-15), fixed relTol=2e-2 NEVER widened; an
  analytic prismatoid/prism-volume arbiter is present as a ready strengthening (untriggered —
  ORACLE-INACCURATE=0). Determinism re-verified (same seed twice → byte-identical batch).
  `src/native` untouched; on run-sim-suite.sh SKIP list (own main()).
- **Breadth — 4th native domain: BLENDS (fillet/chamfer).** `tests/sim/native_blend_fuzz.mm`
  + `scripts/run-sim-native-blend-fuzz.sh`: a DETERMINISTIC seeded generator (splitmix64→
  xoshiro256**, seeded ONLY by FUZZ_SEED) drives random VALID inputs from six native-claimed
  families — planar-dihedral chamfer + fillet (box edge), constant- AND variable-linear-radius
  curved fillet, and symmetric + asymmetric cone-frustum chamfer of a convex cylinder↔cap
  circular rim — through BOTH the OCCT-FREE native blend builder called DIRECTLY (`blend::
  chamfer_edges`/`fillet_edges`/`curved_fillet_edge`/`variable_fillet_edge`/`curved_chamfer_
  edge[_asym]`, measured by the native tessellator) AND the OCCT oracle (`BRepFilletAPI_
  MakeFillet`/`MakeChamfer`, measured by `BRepGProp`), plus a sparse out-of-scope `Rc<2r`
  fillet to exercise the native NULL→OCCT DECLINE branch. Each AGREE family carries a CLOSED-
  FORM removed-volume analytic arbiter (torus-canal Pappus fillet; cone-frustum
  π·d1·d2·(Rc−d2/3); box-edge prism/groove) so a native result matching exact math while OCCT
  is the outlier is logged ORACLE-INACCURATE (native vindicated), never a bar failure. Four
  seeds (0x5744EE9911 N=96 → 91/5/0; 0xC0FFEE1234 N=160 → 154/4/0; 0xDEADBEEF99 N=160 →
  147/10/0; 0x77A9F1E3B5 N=160 → 156/3/0): **0 DISAGREED** on every seed, planar chamfer
  native==OCCT exact, curved families deflection-bounded under a FIXED never-widened tol
  (vol=2e-2 area=3e-2; max observed bias ~1.7e-2/2.6e-2); native-vs-exact-math ≤~1.6e-3 every
  family. The variable-linear curved fillet surfaced OCCT evolved-surface drift while native
  held ~2e-4 vs exact math → logged ORACLE-INACCURATE. Concave stepped-shaft fillet +
  offset/shell are an honest domain-level decline for this first blend slice. `src/native`
  untouched; on run-sim-suite.sh SKIP list (own main(), std::_Exit).
- **Breadth — 5th native domain: WRAP-EMBOSS (feature on a cylinder lateral face).**
  `tests/sim/native_wrap_emboss_fuzz.mm` + `scripts/run-sim-native-wrap-emboss-fuzz.sh`: a
  DETERMINISTIC seeded generator (splitmix64→xoshiro256**, seeded ONLY by FUZZ_SEED) drives
  random VALID inputs from four native-claimed families — a rectangular PAD emboss (material
  added), a rectangular DEBOSS pocket, and a convex N-gon emboss/deboss — all wrapped onto a
  CYLINDER lateral face, through BOTH the OCCT-FREE native builder called DIRECTLY
  (`feature::wrap_emboss`, measured by the native tessellator) AND the PRIMARY closed-form
  curvature-corrected changed-volume oracle `A·|Rout²−R²|/(2R)`, plus a SECONDARY OCCT-boolean
  reconstruction (base cylinder FUSED/CUT with a wrapped angular-sector wedge, measured by
  `BRepGProp`) that is clean for the rectangle footprints and is the only independent AREA
  oracle. Sparse out-of-scope inputs (non-cylindrical base, >2π footprint, deboss depth ≥ R,
  self-intersecting loop) exercise the native NULL→OCCT DECLINE branch. Two seeds
  (0x5745E6B055 N=120 → 107 AGREED / 0 DISAGREED / 13 BOTH-DECLINED, per-family emboss-rect 39
  / deboss-rect 27 / emboss-poly 25 / deboss-poly 16, 66 OCCT rect reconstructions; 0xC0FFEE01
  N=240 → 204 AGREED / 0 DISAGREED / 36 BOTH-DECLINED, per-family 49/58/45/52, 107 OCCT rect
  reconstructions): **0 DISAGREED** on both seeds, rectangle AGREE matches the OCCT
  reconstruction and the closed form, polygon AGREE matches the closed form (OCCT recon
  honestly skipped for arc footprints), all out-of-scope exercisers route to BOTH-DECLINED
  (DECLINE fires, never DISAGREE), max native-vs-oracle bias vol=7.641e-3 (~2.6× under the
  FIXED vol=2e-2 area=3e-2 tol, NEVER widened). Determinism re-verified (same seed → identical
  classification counts). `src/native` untouched; on run-sim-suite.sh SKIP list (own main()).
- **Breadth — 9th native domain: REFERENCE / DATUM GEOMETRY (datum queries on posed solids).**
  `tests/sim/native_reference_geometry_fuzz.mm` + `scripts/run-sim-native-reference-geometry-fuzz.sh`:
  a DETERMINISTIC seeded generator (splitmix64→xoshiro256**, seeded ONLY by FUZZ_SEED) builds a
  random VALID base solid (BOX / NGON prism / CYLINDER / CONE frustum) via the OCCT-FREE native
  construct builders, applies a random RIGID pose (rotate any axis + translate, NO scale/mirror →
  every datum transforms EXACTLY) via `Shape::located(math::Transform)`, and drives every M-REF
  reference service (`faceAxis`/`refAxisFromFace`, `refPlaneFromFace`, `refAxisFromEdge`,
  `outerRimChain`, `offsetFaceBoundary`, `tangentChain`) on the posed native solid through BOTH the
  OCCT topology-query oracle (`gp_Cylinder`/`gp_Cone::Axis`, `gp_Pln`, `gp_Lin`, `BRepTools::
  OuterWire`, `BRepOffsetAPI_MakeOffset`, `BRepAdaptor_Curve::D1`) AND a THIRD engine-independent
  closed-form datum image (the KNOWN construction axis +Y / cap normal / edge dir / cap polygon
  transformed by the same pose in plain fp64) as the PRIMARY arbiter. The reference.h scoped
  declines (a circular-cap offset, a freeform edge in a tangent walk) are FIRST-CLASS declines the
  closed form confirms; the circular-cap `outerRimChain` is arbitrated STRUCTURALLY (rim id set ==
  the native cap face's own outer wire, confirmed circular by the OCCT circle) because the native
  periodic revolution cap stores its rim as arc edges vs OCCT's single seam edge (a legitimate
  representational difference, not a datum defect). Two seeds (0x9EF12A0055 N=96 → 480 AGREED / 58
  HONESTLY-DECLINED / 0 DISAGREED / 0 ORACLE_UNRELIABLE; 0xC0DEDA7A11 N=96 → 480 / 41 / 0 / 0):
  **0 DISAGREED** on both seeds, each of the 4 base families AND each of the 6 ops with ≥1 AGREED,
  analytic-exact datums (axis dir/origin 0–2.2e-16, offset area dA ≤ ~1e-14) under a FIXED
  never-widened rigid tol (dir 1e-9, point 1e-7, offset 1e-6). Determinism re-verified (same seed →
  byte-identical 538-line batch). `src/native` byte-unchanged; on run-sim-suite.sh SKIP list (own
  main(), `std::_Exit`). OpenSpec change `moat-m6i-reference-geometry-fuzz`.
- **Breadth — 10th native domain: DIRECT-MODELING (direct-edit ops through the `cc_*` facade
  under BOTH engines).** `tests/sim/native_directmodel_fuzz.mm` +
  `scripts/run-sim-native-directmodel-fuzz.sh`: a DETERMINISTIC seeded generator (splitmix64→
  xoshiro256**, seeded ONLY by FUZZ_SEED) builds a random VALID base solid (BOX / NGON prism /
  CYLINDER / CONE frustum) IDENTICALLY under both engines via `cc_solid_extrude` /
  `cc_solid_revolve`, then drives one random direct-model op — `cc_split_plane` (axis-aligned +
  OBLIQUE, random keep side), `cc_replace_face` (parallel planar-cap grow/trim offset), or
  `cc_project_point_on_face` (random exterior point) — through BOTH `cc_set_engine(1)`
  (NativeEngine, the OCCT-free DM core; split/offset seam trace is `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`-gated,
  so the harness links numsci) AND `cc_set_engine(0)` (the OCCT adapter oracle), comparing the
  results by `cc_mass_properties` / `cc_bounding_box` (each shape measured under the engine that
  built it — guarding a real cross-engine unwrap crash) AND against a THIRD engine-independent
  CLOSED-FORM arbiter in fp64 (exact half-space keep-volume + partition closure V+ + V− == V for
  splits; `ΔV == capArea·offset` for constant-section cap offsets; planar / cylinder-radial foot
  for projections). Unlike the eight internal-C++ fuzzers this drives the SHIPPING `cc_*` path
  (like native_hlr_parity). This is the FIRST fuzz domain for direct-modeling (the three DM ops
  had per-op parity but no fuzz). Two seeds (0xD3ADBEE710 N=80 → 39 AGREED / 29 HONESTLY-DECLINED
  / 0 DISAGREED / 11 ORACLE-INACCURATE / 0 ORACLE_UNRELIABLE / 1 BOTH-DECLINED; 0x5EC0FFEE42 N=80
  → 48 / 26 / 0 / 5 / 0 / 1): **0 DISAGREED** on both seeds, each of the 4 base families AND each
  of SPLIT/OFFSET/PROJECT with ≥1 AGREED, planar cuts/offsets native==OCCT==exact-math to ~1e-16
  and projections foot-exact, under a FIXED never-widened tol (vol 2e-2 / area 3e-2 / bbox 1.5e-2
  / math 5e-3 / foot 1e-6). SURFACED an OCCT-facade limitation the curated DM parity hides: raw
  `cc_replace_face` on OCCT is a half-space CUT (trim-only), so a cap GROW leaves the OCCT solid
  un-grown while native matches exact `capArea·offset` → logged ORACLE-INACCURATE (native
  vindicated), never a bar failure; cone-lateral projection + cone cap offset are first-class
  HONESTLY-DECLINED (native NULL → OCCT). Determinism re-verified (same seed → byte-identical
  batch). `src/native` / `src/engine` / `include` / the `cc_*` ABI byte-unchanged; on
  run-sim-suite.sh SKIP list (own main(), `std::_Exit`). OpenSpec change
  `moat-m6j-directmodel-fuzz`.
- REMAINING (asymptotic, gates M8): extend the generator across the remaining blend families
  (concave stepped-shaft, offset/shell), healing, and section curves;
  loop-until-dry critics; the standing zero-silent-wrong-results bar.

### M7 — Tier-4 construction robustness · ~1–3 py · independent
**M7a first slice LANDED (verified native-vs-OCCT at both gates):** the N-section (≥3)
planar ruled loft is now reachable through a new ADDITIVE facade entry
`cc_solid_loft_sections`, exposing the already-proven OCCT-free `build_loft_sections`
(equal- and mismatched-count sections) with a real OCCT `ThruSections` oracle, engine
self-verify → OCCT fallback, and an honest self-verify decline for candidates whose mesh is
not robustly watertight (e.g. an asymmetric expand-then-contract spool that T-junctions the
tessellator's shared-ring seam — volume exact, mesh not; discarded → OCCT rather than
weaken the tessellator). Gate 1 (host, no OCCT): `test_native_loft` 21/21. Gate 2 (sim vs
`ThruSections`): `native_loft_parity` 39/39. Additive-only (`cc_kernel.h` no deletions),
`src/native/**` 0 OCCT includes, tessellator untouched.

**M7-tail LANDED — straight-spine guided-ORIENT sweep native (overturns the M7a decline):** M7a
honest-declined a guide-aimed sweep after measuring a rigid law that was volume-correct but ~7 %
spatially wrong (bboxΔ 0.54). M7-tail reverse-engineered OCCT's actual `MakePipeShell +
SetMode(guide, CE=false, NoContact)` law from source (`GeomFill_GuideTrihedronPlan::D0`) and found
M7a *misdiagnosed* it: the law IS a rigid per-station frame, but keyed to the guide point in the
plane **perpendicular to the spine tangent**, not a guide-parameter-fraction aim. Fixing the
correspondence fixes the trap. New additive `cc_guided_orient_sweep` (distinct from the scale-splay
`cc_guided_sweep`) + `build_guided_orient_sweep` (`sweep.h`), self-verify MANDATORILY including a
bbox/Hausdorff SPATIAL check (the explicit anti-M7a-trap safeguard), NULL→OCCT for a curved spine.
Verified vs OCCT (`native_sweep_parity` 19/19) with the spatial gate: offset guide vol rel 1.8e-16 /
bboxΔ 1e-7; rotating guide (the M7a trap) vol rel 2.95e-3 / **bboxΔ 2.49e-4** (vs M7a's 0.54).

**M7t LANDED — real-twist `twisted_sweep` + curved-rail `loft_along_rail` native (both gates):**
the last two Class-B construct tails. The recorded twist decline ("a densified twisted saddle
ruled tube does not weld watertight") was empirically *false* — the real error was a missing
densification. `build_twisted_sweep` now DENSIFIES the straight spine so each ruled band's twist
stays under a per-band bound (`kMaxBandTwist`), reusing the landed Frenet section frame +
`assembleRingTube`; the tube welds watertight at every deflection and its volume converges to the
area-preserving analytic value (a pure twist preserves the cross-section area). `build_loft_along_rail`
now serves a smooth curved rail via an RMF-transported section morph densified to a per-band turn
bound (`kMaxBandTurn`), converging to the Pappus torus-sector volume. Both keep the engine
`robustlyWatertight` self-verify → OCCT. Gate 1 (host, no OCCT): `test_native_sweep` +
`test_native_engine` green (twist → area·L, rail → Pappus). Gate 2 (sim vs OCCT
`ThruSections` / `MakePipeShell`): `native_construct_tails_parity` **8/8** — real-twist vol rel
1.82e-3 / bboxΔ 1.0e-7 / χ=2, curved-rail vol rel 3.87e-4 / χ=2. Sharpened declines: a
twist COMBINED WITH a scale (twist+shrink saddle, not robustly weldable) and a tight-kink rail /
coarse section that won't weld → engine self-verify discards → OCCT (rel 0, active=1). Additive,
`src/native/**` OCCT-free, `cc_*` unchanged, tessellator untouched.

Still deferred (honest decline): a twist+scale saddle and a tight-kink / coarse-section rail
(engine self-verify discards → OCCT); **non-planar-cap loft** (needs a filling surface, no
closed-form volume); **fine-pitch self-intersecting threads** (intersecting-helicoid trimming —
needs M1/M2). Independent of the freeform-boolean chain except fine-pitch (needs M2).
- *Oracle:* `BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell` / `ThruSections` / thread fixtures (volume/watertight).

### M-REF — Reference / datum geometry + topology reads · **LANDED** (bounded, was Class-B)
**Added because the CyberCad app depends on it and no numbered stage covered it** (a MUST-GO-
NATIVE Class-B bucket, 22 app sites). The seven READ-ONLY datum / reference queries that
hard-errored on a native body now dispatch NATIVE through the new OCCT-FREE, header-only
`src/native/reference/reference.h` (`cybercad::native::reference`), computed from the landed
topology graph + frame math and consuming `src/native/{math,topology}` read-only:
- **Landed native (both gates green):** `cc_face_axis` / `cc_ref_axis_from_face` (cylinder/cone
  axis), `cc_ref_plane_from_face` (planar datum plane — outward normal + on-plane origin),
  `cc_ref_axis_from_edge` (straight-edge line axis), `cc_tangent_chain` (C1 edge walk,
  line/circle/ellipse tangents), `cc_outer_rim_chain` (planar-cap outer wire), and
  `cc_offset_face_boundary` (planar-polygon in-plane miter offset).
- **Honest declines → OCCT (measured, never faked):** a non-planar face where a plane is asked;
  a circular/freeform edge axis (no `gp_Lin` oracle); a freeform edge inside a tangent walk; and
  a non-planar / arc-boundary / **growing-convex** (OCCT arc-rounds) / self-intersecting offset —
  the offset is deliberately scoped to the case that provably coincides with
  `BRepOffsetAPI_MakeOffset`. A decline returns a clean error and the facade falls through to
  OCCT; a native void is never forwarded.
- **Gates:** host `tests/native/test_native_reference.cpp` (closed-form, OCCT-free, 13/13) + sim
  `tests/sim/native_reference_parity.mm` via `scripts/run-sim-native-reference.sh` (native-vs-OCCT
  `gp_Pln`/`gp_Cylinder`/`gp_Lin`/`BRepTools::OuterWire`/`MakeOffset`/D1-tangent, 8/8). `cc_*` ABI
  unchanged; 0 OCCT includes under `src/native/**`. OpenSpec change `moat-mref-reference-topology`.

### M-DM — Direct modeling / synchronous editing · ~1.5–3 py · needs M2 + M3 + M5
**Added because the CyberCad app depends on it and no other stage covered it.** The app drives
direct-modeling operations through the `cc_*` ABI that are OCCT-only in the kernel today:
`cc_split_plane`, `cc_replace_face`, `cc_replace_face_to_plane`, plus the project tool. These are
*local B-rep re-solving* operations (the heart of synchronous/direct modeling), distinct from the
feature-tree construction the other stages cover. Substages:
- **DM1 — `cc_split_plane`** (split a solid by a plane into pieces). **FIRST SLICE LANDED** (native,
  additive, OCCT-free). `NativeEngine::split_plane` now routes native B-rep bodies through
  `native/boolean/split_plane.h::splitByPlane`, which composes the two landed verbs unchanged:
  `freeformHalfSpaceCut` (KeepSide::Below/Above → the two pieces) for a single-freeform-walled operand,
  else `boolean_solid(operand, discard-half-space-box, Cut)` for an all-planar polyhedron. Each piece
  is accepted only after the mandatory `watertightVolume` self-verify; otherwise an honest decline
  (the same clean error the pre-DM1 path returned — a native void is never handed to OCCT).
  - *Native cases (both gates green):* axis-aligned **BOX** / planar polyhedron (host partition-closure
    fp-exact; sim volume/area rel ≤ 2.3e-16 vs OCCT) and the bowl-lidded **PRISM** with one freeform
    wall (host closed-form band; sim vol rel ≤ 5.5e-3, area ≤ 6e-4, χ=2, bbox ≤ 1e-7, partition
    closure 5.4e-3 — all inside the landed curved-slice tolerances, never widened).
  - *Honest declines → OCCT (measured, not faked):* the **perpendicular cylinder slice** is `cyl − box`,
    which the landed curved slice (`curved::tryBoxCylinder`) explicitly excludes → NULL both sides;
    likewise a grazing-tangent plane, a degenerate/missing plane, a multi-freeform operand, a mesh-only
    or foreign body. The design's original case C (native cylinder ⊥ slice) was demoted to this decline
    — adding a cylinder-slice verb would violate the consume-unchanged discipline.
  - *Gates:* host `tests/native/test_native_split_plane.cpp` (partition-closure, OCCT-free, 5/5) +
    sim `tests/sim/native_split_plane_parity.mm` (native-vs-OCCT, 31/31). Remaining ~0.3–0.7 py for
    oblique-plane / multi-lump breadth. cc_* ABI unchanged; OCCT bodies byte-identical.
  - *Zero-regression (substrate-gated):* `split_plane.h` reaches the freeform seam trace
    `ssi::trace_intersection`, defined only under `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, so the always-compiled
    `native_engine.cpp` gates both the include and the native-split body on `#ifdef CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`
    (native split honestly declines when OFF, as pre-DM1). Verified: NUMSCI-OFF host links
    `test_native_engine`/`test_native_boolean` (pass) with 0 `trace_intersection` refs (matches `main`),
    and `run-sim-native-boolean.sh` links + 25/25. NUMSCI-ON host suite + split-plane sim (31/31) green.
- **DM2 — `cc_replace_face_to_plane`** ✅ *(landed — native slice)* (flatten/retarget a planar face to a
  target plane, re-solving adjacent planar faces — extend neighbours to the new plane, retrim, heal).
  Native `directmodel::replaceFaceToPlane` (`src/native/directmodel/replace_face.h`, OCCT-FREE, header-
  only) composes the LANDED DM1 `splitByPlane` + `boolean_solid(Fuse)` + `build_prism`: a parallel PULL is
  one DM1 cut, a parallel PUSH is a face-loop slab fused on, a tilted/mixed move is GROW-then-TRIM (one
  Fuse + one tilted cut — NOT an N-cut half-space chain, which the DIAGNOSE probe showed breaks the
  watertight self-verify at ~4 cuts). δ is affine over the planar face, so the swept volume is the exact
  closed form `ΔV = A_F·d̄`. Mandatory re-solve self-verify (watertight closed 2-manifold, single lump
  χ=2, distinct-plane count preserved, moved face on the target plane, volume == `V₀+A_F·d̄`) → else NULL →
  honest decline. `native_engine.cpp::replace_face_to_plane` gates the native path on `#ifdef
  CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI` (an OCCT body forwards to the OCCT half-space-cut oracle unchanged; a native body
  the slice can't re-solve declines honestly, never handed to OCCT). Verified BOTH gates: host closed-form
  (`test_native_replace_face`, 8/8 — parallel push/pull fp-exact, tilted trim + tilted grow-then-trim,
  and declines: curved neighbour / degenerate normal / no-op / topology-change) and sim native-vs-OCCT
  plane-cut-and-extend oracle (`run-sim-native-replace-face.sh`, 32/32, volume/area/watertight/χ/bbox
  fp-exact). Honest declines (→ OCCT): curved neighbour, non-planar picked face, degenerate/topology-
  changing/non-convex move. Bounded. ~0.5–1.5 py.
- **DM3 — `cc_replace_face` (general push-pull / move-face)** ✅ *(pure-offset slice landed — native)*
  — retarget a planar face by offsetting it along its own outward normal (and, in general, tilting it),
  trimming the solid to the new plane. Native `directmodel::replaceFaceOffsetTilt`
  (`src/native/directmodel/replace_face_general.h`, OCCT-FREE, header-only) DERIVES the target plane
  `(o + n̂_F·offset, n̂_F)` for the pure-offset case (`tiltDeg ≈ 0`) and re-solves via the byte-frozen DM2
  `replaceFaceToPlane` (grow-then-trim = 1 Fuse + 1 Cut, watertight self-verified at `V₀ + A_F·offset`).
  `native_engine.cpp::replace_face` now serves a native body (was a hard `CC_NATIVE_BODY_UNSUPPORTED`);
  an OCCT body forwards. GATE (a) HOST 6/6 (`test_native_replace_face_general` — pure push/pull fp-exact,
  off-axis face offset, + declines). GATE (b) SIM (`native_dm3_dm4_parity.mm`, booted sim, 36/36 combined with DM4) vs
  the OCCT move-face oracle: volume/area rel ≤ 3.5e-16, off-axis bbox 1.8e-15, watertight, Euler χ=2.
  HONEST DECLINE: a non-zero tilt (OCCT face-parametrization X-axis is a foreign convention we don't
  reproduce for a native body — the sharpened next blocker), a non-planar picked face, a curved neighbour
  → OCCT. Residual (general tilt / arbitrary target surface) needs M2/M3/M5 breadth. ~1–2 py total.
- **DM4 — project tool** ✅ *(analytic slice landed — native)* — additive `cc_project_point_on_face`:
  drop a point onto a face's analytic surface, returning the closed-form foot-of-perpendicular + distance.
  Native `directmodel::projectPointOnFace` (`src/native/directmodel/project.h`, OCCT-FREE, header-only) is
  the closed-form normal projection for plane / cylinder / sphere; `OcctEngine::project_point_on_face` =
  the `GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnSurf` oracle. GATE (a) HOST 9/9 (`test_native_project` — plane/cylinder/sphere
  feet + declines cone/axis/centre/foreign). GATE (b) SIM vs `GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnSurf` — foot coords +
  distance to machine precision (0). HONEST DECLINE: cone / torus / freeform, and ambiguous poses (point on
  a cylinder axis / at a sphere centre) → OCCT. ~0.5–1 py.
- *Oracle:* `BRepFeat` / `BRepAlgoAPI` / `ShapeUpgrade` on the re-solved solid (volume/watertight/
  topology); DM1 also has a closed-form partition oracle (the two pieces sum to the whole).
- *Bounded* (well-understood synchronous-modeling engineering), not asymptotic. **Gates a
  fully-OCCT-free *app*, though not the kernel's geometry primitives.**

### M-GS — Kernel geometry services for drafting & analysis · ~2.5–5 py · needs tessellate + M2
**Added from the app audit: the CyberCad app's 2D-drawing and measurement features depend on OCCT
geometry *services* the native kernel does not provide** (distinct from solid-modeling primitives).
Surfaced by the app's `DrawingProjector` / `ManufacturingDrawing` / `Measure` / `SectionGeometry`
tests. Substages:
- **GS1 — HLR (hidden-line removal) + drawing projection** — project a B-rep's edges onto a drawing
  plane and classify visible vs hidden segments against the occluding faces (OCCT `HLRBRep_Algo`).
  The 2D-drawings feature (`DrawingProjector`, `ProjectEdges`, `ProjectBody`) cannot go OCCT-free
  without it. Consumes the native tessellator + topology; the algorithm itself is net-new. ~1–2 py.
  - *Status (POLYHEDRAL slice — TWO-GATE COMPLETE, change `moat-hlr-hidden-line-removal`):*
    OCCT-free header-only orthographic-HLR core at `src/native/drafting/` (`orthographic_hlr.h`):
    orthographic edge projection → Möller–Trumbore occlusion against the M0 triangle mesh →
    midpoint-interior visibility classification → bisection edge-splitting → disjoint
    visible/hidden 2D sets. Wired end to end behind an additive `cc_hlr_project` accessor
    (facade → `IEngine::hlr_project` → `NativeEngine::hlr_project` over the M0 occluder + the
    deduplicated topology edges; `OcctEngine::hlr_project` = the `HLRBRep_Algo` oracle in
    `src/engine/occt/occt_drafting.cpp`, the only HLR-linked piece).
    **Gate (a) HOST ANALYTIC: PASS** — box from an isometric corner → exactly 9 visible + 3 hidden
    segments (hidden triple meeting at the occluded far corner), plus empty-occluder and
    edge-split invariants; wired into the always-on native suite.
    **Gate (b) SIM native-vs-OCCT `HLRBRep_Algo` parity: PASS** — `tests/sim/native_hlr_parity.mm`
    (via `scripts/run-sim-native-hlr.sh`) drives `cc_hlr_project` under both engines for box (iso +
    oblique), triangle prism, and non-convex L-prism and matches visible/hidden COUNT, total
    projected LENGTH, and endpoint PARTITION to machine epsilon (13/13 PASS; length rel ≤ 2.2e-16,
    partition tol 1e-5).
  - *Status (CURVED slice — TWO-GATE COMPLETE, changes `moat-hlrc-curved-silhouette` +
    `moat-gs1c-curved-hlr`):* the closed-form `n·viewDir=0` silhouette is traced in
    `src/native/drafting/silhouette.h` (OCCT-free, header-only) and fed through the SAME
    occlusion+split path for **cylinder** (two axial generators), **sphere** (great circle),
    **cone / cone-frustum** (two straight contour rulings), and **torus** (`Kind::Torus`; two
    closed turning-point contours). Gate (a) host analytic asserts each silhouette's on-surface
    residual and the `n·viewDir=0` tangency to machine ε (contour point counts, straight-ruling
    vs closed-loop shape), plus the honest declines (axis-parallel cylinder/cone, cone end-on,
    torus axis-view). Gate (b) `native_hlr_parity.mm` compares native vs `HLRBRep_Algo` for
    cylinder/sphere/cone/frustum solids (count + length band + visible⊆oracle-visible
    classification). **Sharpened decline:** a native `cc_solid_revolve` builds a torus as
    rational-B-spline surface-of-revolution BANDS (`Kind::BSpline`), NOT a `Kind::Torus` face, so a
    revolve-built torus DECLINES via the freeform path (a `Kind::Torus` STEP-imported face is
    traced). Freeform (B-spline/Bézier) faces remain declined outright; no wrong visible/hidden
    classification is emitted for any accepted case.
- **GS2 — Section curves** — extract the section *curves* (not just the solid) where a plane cuts a
  solid, incl. capped section geometry (OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_Section`). Largely reachable via the landed
  M2 half-space / SSI seam machinery. ~0.5–1 py.
  **✅ NATIVE (landed).** Header-only, OCCT-free `src/native/section/section.h` behind the additive
  `cc_section_plane` facade: plane∩{plane,cylinder,cone,sphere} closed-form conics assembled into
  closed section loops (+ capped area). **Oblique-cylinder relaxation (this pass):** now that the
  landed ssi `intersectPlaneCylinder` returns the correct oblique ellipse (semi-major `R/|cosθ|`,
  regression `test_native_ssi::plane_cylinder`), GS2's conservative oblique-cylinder DECLINE guard is
  removed and the oblique cut COMPUTES the section ellipse (`a=R/|cosθ|`, `b=R`, area `π·R²/|cosθ|`),
  assembled into a closed `Ellipse` loop like the other conic cases. **Verified both gates:** GATE A
  host closed-form (`test_native_section` 11/0, incl. `cylinder_oblique_section_is_ellipse`;
  `test_native_ssi` 11/0) and GATE B sim native-vs-OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_Section` (`native_section_parity`
  all-pass, oblique case edge-length 22.921187 = OCCT, capped area 39.985946 = OCCT, 1 closed loop).
  **Honest declines preserved (not faked):** plane tangent to a curved face, a non-closing section,
  an arc-trimmed curved-face conic, and freeform/torus faces still return a typed decline; the final
  closed-loop self-verify still guards against emitting any wrong/open section.
- **GS3 — Exact measurement / distance queries** — minimum entity-to-entity distance (point/edge/
  face pairs) + angle, analytically/NURBS-exact rather than mesh-approximate (OCCT
  `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape`). Consumes the native NURBS eval. ~0.5–1.5 py.
  **✅ NATIVE (landed).** Header-only, OCCT-free `src/native/analysis/{distance,angle}.h` behind the
  additive `cc_measure_distance` / `cc_measure_angle` facade. Closed-form analytic·analytic cells
  (point/line/segment/circle/plane/cylinder/sphere, line·line parallel+skew) + deterministic
  seed-and-refine (degree×span grid → Newton polish) for simple-NURBS pairs; angle for
  line·line / plane·plane / line·plane. **Verified both gates:** GATE A host closed-form
  (`test_native_analysis` 47/0, `test_native_analysis_facade` 5/0) and GATE B sim native-vs-OCCT
  `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` (`native_analysis_parity` 21/0, deltas ≤ 1.1e-16).
  **Honest declines (expected, not faked):** genuinely-trimmed freeform patches whose global optimum
  is not certifiable (multiple comparably-deep basins / non-converging constrained-boundary restart)
  return a clean decline via `cc_last_error`, never a guessed minimum.
- **GS4 — Curvature analysis** — Gaussian/mean/principal surface + edge curvature for analysis
  (zebra, draft). Consumes native NURBS derivatives. ~0.3–0.8 py.
  **✅ NATIVE (landed).** Header-only, OCCT-free `src/native/analysis/curvature.h` behind the additive
  `cc_surface_curvature` (→ `[K,H,k1,k2]`) / `cc_edge_curvature` (→ κ) facade. Analytic arm
  (plane 0; sphere `1/R²`,`1/R`; cylinder `0`,`1/(2R)`; cone; torus `cos v/(r(R+r cos v))`) + NURBS
  arm via first/second fundamental forms from native surface derivatives (maxDeriv=2), with the
  outward-normal sign convention (curvature flipped for a `Reversed` face) and `k1≥k2` ordering.
  **Verified both gates:** GATE A host closed-form and GATE B sim vs OCCT
  `GeomLProp_SLProps`/`GeomLProp_CLProps`. **Honest declines:** parametric singularity
  (`EG−F² ≤ ε·max(E,G)²`), cone apex, and degenerate edge tangent (`‖C′‖≤ε`) return a clean decline.
- **GS5 — Inertia / principal moments** — a mesh-based inertia tensor (signed-tetra second moments
  over the M0 triangulation about the centroid, then symmetric-3×3 cyclic-Jacobi eigen).
  **✅ NATIVE (landed).** Header-only, OCCT-free `src/native/analysis/inertia.h::principalInertia`;
  `NativeEngine::principal_moments` rewired from the `CC_NATIVE_BODY_UNSUPPORTED → OCCT` stub to the
  native path, **guarded by a watertight precondition** (open / non-watertight body → honest decline →
  OCCT, never a wrong tensor). **Verified both gates:** GATE A host closed-form — box `(V/12){b²+c²…}`
  exact (relmax 1.2e-15), cylinder ≤3e-3, sphere `2/5 V r²` O(1/n²)→1.8e-3; GATE B sim vs OCCT
  `GProp_PrincipalProps` (box relmax 1.24e-15, cylinder 2.0e-4, sphere 1.8e-3, principal axes matched).
  **Honest decline:** open-body inertia is non-certifiable (returns `std::nullopt` / declines to OCCT).
  Re-ran the M6 mass-properties differential fuzzer: 0 DISAGREED, zero silent wrong masses.
- **GS6 — B-rep validity checking** — a native `cc_check_solid` (closed 2-manifold, consistent outward
  orientation, no self-intersection, no degenerate/zero-area face or zero-length edge, finite coords),
  reusing the tessellator + topology + GS3 distance for the self-intersection test.
  **✅ NATIVE (landed).** Header-only, OCCT-free `src/native/analysis/validity.h::checkSolidMesh` +
  `ValidityReport`, behind the additive `int cc_check_solid(body, CCValidityReport*)` /
  `CCValidityReport` / `CCValidityCheck` (ABI additive-only; `cc_principal_moments` unchanged) with
  `NativeEngine::check_solid`, an `IEngine` default, and `OcctEngine::check_solid` (BRepCheck oracle).
  **Verified both gates:** GATE A host fixtures of KNOWN state — valid box/cyl/sphere → valid;
  non-closed shell → `closed=0`; flipped face → `oriented=0`; zero-area/zero-length → `nondegenerate=0`;
  interpenetrating polyhedron → `noSelfIntersection=0`; each `first_failure` names the specific
  invalidity; GATE B sim vs OCCT `BRepCheck_Analyzer::IsValid` on the SAME valid AND deliberately-broken
  fixtures — matched on every one. **Honest decline:** the self-intersection check returns UNDECIDABLE
  (report `decided=0`, never a false `valid`) where no-self-intersection is not robustly certifiable
  (e.g. a general freeform patch). Gates trustworthy import (with M5) and any healing UX.
- *Oracle:* `HLRBRep_Algo` / `BRepAlgoAPI_Section` / `BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape` / `BRepLProp` on
  visible-segment sets / section-curve length+topology / min-distance / curvature values.
- *Bounded.* GS2/GS3/GS4 reuse landed native machinery; **GS1 (HLR) is the substantial one** and the
  hard blocker for OCCT-free 2D drawings. **Gates a fully-OCCT-free *app* with drawings, not the
  kernel's solid-modeling primitives.**

### M-TX — Native affine transforms for native bodies · ✅ LANDED
The rigid/affine transform layer behind the app's translate / rotate / mirror / scale / place
tools — `cc_translate_shape`, `cc_rotate_shape_about`, `cc_mirror_shape`, `cc_scale_shape`,
`cc_scale_shape_about`, `cc_place_on_frame` — used to hard-error (`CC_NATIVE_BODY_UNSUPPORTED`)
on a NATIVE body; the legacy mesh extrude `cc_extrude` forwarded unconditionally to OCCT.
- **✅ NATIVE (landed).** These six ops now apply a `math::Transform` to a native body via the
  proven `topology::Shape::located(math::Transform)` + `SolidMesher` placement path (the same
  path `native_transform_fuzz.mm` certifies vs OCCT `BRepBuilderAPI_Transform` + closed-form).
  A MIRROR flips handedness (signed-vol sign) while staying a valid watertight positive-|vol|
  solid; a zero/degenerate scale (and zero axis / normal / degenerate frame) declines honestly;
  a NON-native body forwards to OCCT unchanged. `cc_extrude` now attempts the native prism first.
- *Two-gate proven.* Gate (a) host-analytic ABI invariants (`tests/test_native_engine.cpp`, 7 new
  cases, OCCT-free); gate (b) SIM native-vs-OCCT ABI parity driving `cc_*` under BOTH engines
  (`tests/sim/native_transform_parity.mm`, box + cylinder, 88/88) plus the pre-existing
  transform-chain fuzzer. `src/native/**` untouched (OCCT-free); `cc_*` ABI unchanged.
- *Bounded, cheap.* The largest app-facing OCCT fall-through by call-site count (27 transform +
  10 extrude sites) closed with no new geometry algorithms — pure placement composition.

### M8 — `drop-occt` — unlink OCCT · gated on M0–M7 + **M-DM** + **M-GS** + M6 bar
> **Itemized unlink checklist:** [DROP-OCCT-READINESS.md](DROP-OCCT-READINESS.md) — every OCCT fall-through site classified A (now-native) / B (must-go-native, ~6.5–15 py) / C (IGES decline), with the concrete unlink sequence and readiness verdict.

Delete `src/engine/occt`, drop the OCCT link, remove/stub `cc_iges_*`. **Only** once every
stage above (including **M-DM** for direct modeling and **M-GS** for the app's drafting/measurement
geometry services) is native at the acceptance bar AND the M6 completeness bar holds (differential
fuzzing shows zero silent wrong results — every non-native input honestly declines with a clear error
rather than a fabricated shape). This is the terminal step; it does not begin until the fallback is
provably unnecessary for the supported domain.
**IGES note (app-relevant):** `cc_iges_import/export` is **descoped** from native but the app *uses*
it — so a fully-OCCT-free *app* additionally requires an IGES decision: drop IGES from the app, keep a
thin OCCT-linked IGES shim (app not 100 % OCCT-free), or reimplement IGES natively (~1.5–3 py, out of
current scope).

**M8 scoped-unlink DRY-RUN rehearsal (measured 2026-07-08).** A throwaway, non-shipping CMake option
`CYBERCAD_M8_REHEARSAL` (branch `moat-m8dry`) wires the build's DEFAULT active engine to
`NativeEngine`-over-stub — the exact post-unlink wiring — without deleting `src/engine/occt` or changing
any shipping default. The full HOST suite + a per-op decline probe were run against it. Findings (full
detail in [DROP-OCCT-READINESS.md](DROP-OCCT-READINESS.md) §6):
- **Build:** links clean with **zero** OCCT TUs and no `OcctEngine` symbol referenced — the terminal
  "delete `src/engine/occt`" step is build-safe *today*.
- **Suite:** 53/56 pass; **0 crashes, 0 silent-wrong**. The 3 "fails" (`test_guard`, `test_abi`,
  `test_native_engine`) are all the SAME root cause — they assert the *shipping-default* invariant
  ("default = stub / no B-rep / not native") that the rehearsal deliberately inverts; they are sentinel
  flips, not regressions.
- **Per-op probe:** every Class-B op (`fillet_face`, `full_round_fillet[_faces]`, `fillet_edges_g2`,
  `twisted_sweep` real-twist, `loft_along_rail` curved-rail, `thread_apply`) and every Class-C op
  (`iges_import/_export`) **CLEANLY DECLINES** (id=0 + honest `cc_last_error`); every Class-A spine op
  (`solid_revolve/_loft/_tessellate/_mass_properties/_extrude`) **SERVES NATIVELY**.
- **Static-vs-measured:** the static A/B/C classification **held** — no Class-A op crashed or returned a
  fabricated shape, no B/C op declined without a reason. The static audit is empirically confirmed.
- **Assessment:** the scoped unlink is **build-reachable now**; the residual M2/M3/remaining-B work is
  about *product breadth* (turning B/C declines back into served ops), NOT about making the unlink build
  or preventing silent-wrong. What is TRULY required to *build* OCCT-free = nothing further. What is
  required to *ship* without regressing the supported domain = the M2/M3 freeform-blend/boolean breadth
  (~3–8 py) for the 4 M3 OCCT-only fillets + `boolean` freeform residual, the M7/M7b tails for
  `twisted_sweep`/`loft_along_rail`/fine-pitch threads (~1–2 py), and the IGES product decision.

**M8 drop-OCCT payoff — MEASURED (branch `moat-bench`).** The rehearsal above proves the unlink is
*build-safe*; this measures *why it is worth doing*. Harness `tests/sim/native_vs_occt_bench.cpp` +
runners `scripts/bench-native-vs-occt.sh` (latency) and `scripts/bench-binary-size.sh` (size) drive the
same `cc_*` ops under both engines (`cc_set_engine`) and compare the OCCT-linked vs native-only builds.
Full method + tables in [docs/BENCH-native-vs-occt.md](../docs/BENCH-native-vs-occt.md). Headline numbers:
- **Latency (HOST, median-of-25, ratio = OCCT/native — the portable signal; device absolute differs):**
  planar **boolean** fuse/cut/common **8–20×** faster native (biggest on small/medium interactive models);
  **tessellate 11–15×**; **mass_properties 7–8×** — all on identical self-verified-correct results (native
  BSP-CSG fuse volume == OCCT to fp round-off). `section` is **native-only** (the OCCT adapter declines
  `cc_section_plane`); `fillet_edges` **forwards to OCCT** (no native win — a clean decline after unlink,
  reported honestly, not as a speedup).
- **Binary size (iossim arm64):** dropping OCCT removes **112 MB** of statically-archived OCCT toolkits
  (140 MB full trimmed install) + a **1.08 MB** kernel-side adapter (**16 TUs, 259 symbols** eliminated),
  for a **28 MB dead-stripped in-binary reduction** on a representative reachable set (OCCT exe 29.8 MB vs
  native-only 1.7 MB) — the concrete iPad shipping win. Native-only kernel `.a` is 2.66 MB.

## Parallelism — what can be researched concurrently

These are multi-py research arcs, so "parallel" means **separate efforts / tracks**, not the
short-lived workflow-parallelism used for bounded slices. Two things make a stage
parallelizable: (a) its **upstream dependency** is met, and (b) it touches a **disjoint
`src/native` module** (so tracks integrate cleanly — the same isolation the parallel bounded
slices used). Both are captured below.

> **Wave-1 first slices LANDED (all verified native-vs-OCCT).** The four launched Wave-1 tracks
> each banked a first verified slice: **M0** (keystone) trimmed free-form interior mesher,
> **M1** freeform S4-d open-arm branch point (marching 12/12), **M5** opt-in gap bridging
> (heal 6/6), **M6** curved-boolean differential fuzzer (512 trials, 0 DISAGREED). **M7a**
> (construct sweep/loft) has now banked its first verified slice too: the N-section planar
> ruled loft wired to `cc_solid_loft_sections` (Gate 1 21/21, Gate 2 39/39). **This opens Wave
> 2**: with M0's mesher ready and M0+M1 both past a first slice, **M2 (freeform booleans) and
> M4 (general import) can now start in parallel** — alongside the still-running asymptotic
> tracks (M1 breadth, M5, M6) and M7a's remaining residuals (guided sweep, non-planar-cap loft).

> **Wave-2 + M2-substrate batch LANDED (all verified native-vs-OCCT, integrated).** Seven further
> slices banked: **M4** foreign trimmed `B_SPLINE_SURFACE_WITH_KNOTS` admission (STEP parity 79/79 —
> completes the M0 keystone's deferred half) + **M4-rational** `RATIONAL_B_SPLINE_SURFACE` admission
> (83/83); **M7a** N-section loft (39/39, guided-orient sweep honest-declined with a measured self-
> verify-trap); **M5-tail** opt-in planar-hole cap (heal 8/8); **M6-breadth** STEP round-trip
> differential fuzzer (0 DISAGREED, *surfaced* OCCT reader inaccuracy on shallow frustums, native
> vindicated by closed-form). **M2 substrate:** **B2** freeform face-split (12/12) + **B3** point-in-
> freeform-solid membership (crispDISAGREE=0) — the two hard subsystems the M2 decline named. The
> single freeform-boolean **M2** was an honest DECLINE that mapped its blockers; two of its three
> substrate pieces (B2, B3) are now native, leaving only **B1** (the small operand-descriptor join
> point) before the M2 assembly (recognise[B1] → trace[M1] → split[B2] → classify[B3] → weld[M0]).

| Stage | Module (disjoint unit) | Needs | Status / when it can run |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** freeform mesher/trimmer | `tessellate/` | — | ✅ **Wave-1 slice LANDED** — mesher ready; unblocks M2/M4. ✅ **Weld robustness LANDED (deflection-fragility RESOLVED):** shared-curved-edge single-sampling (`edge_mesher.h`+`face_mesher.h`, additive, OCCT-free) welds the freeform boolean seam + bowl-lid quad edges watertight at ANY deflection — the freeform CUT/COMMON no longer oscillate watertight↔decline across `{0.03…0.002}`. Zero regression PROVEN byte-identical (FNV of verts+tris+wt+area+vol) for every existing surface kind; host `41/41`, sim parity `20/20` at d=0.01 AND 0.004. ✅ **M0w CLOSED-INNER-SEAM WELD LANDED (deflection-fragility RESOLVED for the closed seam — the CLOSED-loop analogue of the open-seam single-sampling fix):** the shared CLOSED seam between a curved sub-face (the bowl disk/annulus a smooth-trim split lays) and the flat cap on the cut plane now welds watertight at ANY deflection. Root cause (measured): the seam edge is a 2-pole degree-1 STRAIGHT chord carrying a pcurve on the CURVED sub-face, so the curved side placed its subdivided seam-boundary vertices by evaluating its OWN surface (`S_bowl(pcurve)`, which BULGES off the chord) while the flat cap placed them on the chord — only 399 of ~4788 near-seam vertices coincided at `d=0.004`, so the seam opened. The additive OCCT-free fix (`tessellate/edge_mesher.h` `detail::isSeamChord` + `face_mesher.h` `SeamPins`/`recordSeamChordPins`): a shared seam CHORD carries ONE canonical straight-chord discretization (`d.points`) consumed by both sub-faces; the diverging (curved-side) boundary samples are PINNED by UV correspondence to those canonical points, so both sub-faces emit BIT-IDENTICAL seam vertices and the CDT does not fuse across the seam. Topology-guarded to fire ONLY on a seam chord that genuinely diverges — no analytic primitive, no genuinely-curved shared edge (cylinder cap↔side circle), no `Line` edge is a seam chord — so **every existing mesh is BYTE-IDENTICAL (FNV battery 36/36: box / bump-capped-cylinder curved seam / rational-BSpline cap / bowl operand / mid-wall operand × 6 deflections)**; the only meshes that change are the closed-seam CUT/COMMON solids (non-watertight → watertight). **GATE (a) HOST:** the mid-wall ANNULAR-cap CUT (disk ∪ annulus whose inner hole is the seam) welds watertight (Euler χ=2) and converges to the closed form across `{0.02,0.012,0.008,0.005,0.0025}` (0.62%→0.10%); the dome CUT closed seam welds watertight at the fine `d=0.004` that DECLINED before; full host `ctest` **58/58**. **GATE (b) SIM:** `native_curved_wall_cut_parity.mm` **45/45** — the newly-added fine `CUT d=0.004` matches OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_Common` (volume rel 4.0%, area 0.5%, Hausdorff 3.4e-8) where it declined pre-pin. The curved-wall COMMON's remaining fine-deflection decline is now isolated to the SEPARATE pre-existing curved-RIM weld (a free-form face subdivides the shared bowl↔lid rim beyond the flat lid's need + a coarse near-degenerate sliver) — NOT the closed seam — and stays an honest NULL → OCCT (`moat-m0w-closed-seam-weld`). ✅ **M0-RIM OUTER CURVED-RIM WELD LANDED (the SEPARATE blocker M0w isolated — the CURVED-edge analogue of the seam-chord pin):** the bowl's OUTER curved RIM (a per-segment degree-2 Bézier arc) shared between the free-form annulus and the flat top lid now welds watertight at ANY deflection, so curved-wall COMMON is robust across the FULL ladder. Root cause (measured): the rim is shared on SEPARATE nodes and subdivided to the same fraction list, but the flat lid's planar pcurve does NOT reproduce the 3-D rim arc (`S_lid(pcurve) ≠ C_edge`, diverging up to ~6e-4 ≫ `kSnapEps`), so the rim opened; plus a coarse-regime COINCIDENT triangulation sliver (a rim edge used by 4 triangles) survived. The additive OCCT-free fix (`tessellate/edge_mesher.h` `detail::isCurvedSharedRim` + `face_mesher.h` `recordSeamChordPins` generalized to the curved rim + `solid_mesher.h` coincident-duplicate-triangle drop & orphan-vertex compaction): the diverging lid rim samples are PINNED by UV correspondence to the bowl's ONE canonical rim curve `d.points`, and the degenerate coincident sliver is dropped, so the rim welds `χ=2`. Topology-guarded — `isCurvedSharedRim` admits ONLY degree-≥2 free-form arcs and EXCLUDES analytic `Circle`/`Ellipse` seams BY KIND (every primitive cap↔side / latitude / torus-rim ineligible), and the pin is divergence-gated (`‖S_face(pcurve)−C_edge‖>kSnapEps`, which no primitive trips); the twist pre-pass is untouched, and the sliver drop / orphan compaction fire only when a duplicate / orphan exists — so **every existing mesh is BYTE-IDENTICAL (FNV battery 112 hashes = 14 solid kinds incl. TWISTED loft + twisted-sweep + sphere/cone/cylinder revolves + thread × 8 deflections: 0 non-rim change)**; the only meshes that change are the 5 curved-wall COMMON rim cases (non-watertight → watertight). **GATE (a) HOST:** COMMON welds watertight (Euler χ=2) and converges to the closed-form `V(z≥c)` across the FULL ladder `{0.012,0.0102,0.008,0.006,0.004,0.002,0.001}` (rel 2.0%→0.6%), flipping the `curved_wall_common_rim_weld_fragility` decline test to `curved_wall_common_rim_weld_watertight_across_full_ladder`; full host `ctest` all pass. **GATE (b) SIM:** curved-wall COMMON is now a watertight MATCH to OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_Common` + `BRepGProp` at its ladder (no longer an honest decline). Curved-wall freeform boolean COMMON on the dome/bowl pose is now robust at every deflection (`moat-rim-curved-rim-weld`) |

GATE (a) HOST-analytic (`test_native_step_reader.cpp` +5, 67/67): N shared-box instances at known translations/rotation match closed-form vol/bbox; ≠1-brep / lone-REP_MAP / mixed-Form-A+B DECLINE. GATE (b) SIM vs `STEPControl_Reader` (`native_step_mapped_item_parity.mm`, booted sim, 5/5): 3 instances, vol/area/centroid rel ~1e-16, bbox Δ=0, faces 18=18; no-brep mapped rep declines→OCCT.

GATE (b) SIM PARITY GREEN (`tests/sim/native_first_freeform_boolean_parity.mm`, booted iOS-17 sim): operand reconstructed in OCCT (sewn 6-face `Geom_BezierSurface`-topped solid), cut by `BRepAlgoAPI_Cut`, compared vs native `freeformHalfSpaceCut` on **volume (rel 7.13e-03 ≤ 2e-2), area (rel 4.43e-04), watertightness (closed 2-manifold), topology (Euler χ=2, single closed solid), bbox (worst 1.00e-07) + one-sided Hausdorff (1.57e-07 ≤ 1.5e-2)** — **12/12 PASS**, fixed curved-tessellation tolerances never widened, no native-vs-OCCT discrepancy surfaced (the CUT is correct vs OCCT). Harness has own `main()` + `run-sim-suite.sh` SKIP entry. Blocker (i) SIDESTEPPED by the bowl-lidded-prism operand (its one freeform face has the convex straight-edged loop B2 splits); the **B2 smooth-trim (closed/circular wall) generalisation is DEFERRED** as the next enabler. Every stage NULL-on-decline; OCCT stays the fall-through. Deferred sub-gates: explicit in-harness `BRepClass3d` query-point batch (already `crispDISAGREE=0` in M2c) and a perturbed-candidate discard case (host-driver `NotWatertight` path). **COMMON also LANDED (host gate, M2-breadth):** the complementary keep-side `freeformHalfSpaceCut(A,P,KeepSide::Above) = A∩{x≥0}` (no new geometry — `KeepSide::Above` consumed byte-identical), host gate 4/4 — partition-closure oracle `V(x≤0)+V(x≥0)=V(full)` exact, COMMON watertight at its complementary closed-form volume. **DEFLECTION FRAGILITY — ✅ RESOLVED (M0 weld robustness, shared-curved-edge single-sampling):** the CUT/COMMON deflection oscillation is GONE. Root cause (pinned by measurement, refining the original hypothesis): the per-face `d.points` already agreed to machine ε — the actual leaks were (1) a straight-edge canonical anchor placing its FAR endpoint at the interpolated `ce.a + dir·1` (≈1 ULP off the shared vertex `ce.b`, e.g. `−0.5+0.585 ≠ 0.085`), which competes for the shared corner where a curved seam meets the walls, and (2) the freeform boolean seam carried by the cap and the trimmed freeform sub-face as SEPARATE edge nodes whose independent discretizations diverge ~1 ULP; both split when the point lands on a weld-cell boundary. The additive fix (`tessellate/edge_mesher.h` + `face_mesher.h`, OCCT-free): (a) pin the straight-edge anchor ENDPOINTS to the exact `ce.a`/`ce.b` (the shared vertices), and (b) give a genuinely-curved edge reached via a separate node ONE canonical discretization keyed by its endpoint pair + a **distance-matched** 3-D midpoint (boundary-free, unlike a quantized midpoint), consumed BIT-IDENTICALLY by both incident faces. **GATE (a) HOST:** operand + CUT + COMMON now weld watertight at EVERY deflection of `{0.03,0.02,0.01,0.008,0.004,0.002}` at the closed-form volume (`test_native_freeform_boolean_breadth.cpp::weld_robust_across_full_deflection_sweep`). **GATE (b) SIM:** native-vs-OCCT parity now asserted at 0.01 AND 0.004 (a deflection the pre-fix mesher declined) — **20/20 PASS**. **ZERO REGRESSION PROVEN:** every existing surface kind's mesh (Plane/Cylinder/Sphere/Bézier/BSpline, curved seams, box/holed/loft/sweep/thread/step) is BYTE-IDENTICAL (FNV of all vertices + tris + wt + area + vol) — the only mesh that changes is the freeform operand at the two deflections where it was PREVIOUSLY LEAKING, and there it only fuses the un-welded duplicate vertex (verts 18→17, 42→41) and flips wt 0→1; full host suite `41/41`. **FUSE ✅ LANDED — FIRST two-operand freeform boolean, BOTH gates (M2-FUSE):** a freeform bowl-lidded prism `A` FUSED with a FINITE all-planar box `B` for the single-curved-cut pose.

Instrumented open-edge + pairwise-distance measurement (this iteration) REFUTES the earlier "interior mesh resonates / FENCE interior vertices" hypothesis: **ZERO** annulus interior vertices land within the weld cell (`weldTol = max(deflection·0.5, 1e-7)`) of any boundary VERTEX *or* boundary SEGMENT at d∈{0.004,0.006,0.011} — a seam fence (built + PROVEN byte-identical for `ffb_operand`/`curved_wall_operand` at 6 deflections) never fires and does NOT fix COMMON. The real fragility is the spatial WELD itself, in two distinct regimes: (1) **COARSE deflection** — the seam hole of the annulus is discretized at the FIXED M1 trace density (~301 nodes, spacing ~0.0027–0.0039 in 3-D, deflection-INDEPENDENT because `splitFaceSmoothTrim` builds one degree-1 straight edge per WLine node → `minSegs=1` each), so once `weldTol > seam spacing` (d ≳ 0.011: 399 seam-boundary pairs within tol) the weld MERGES ADJACENT seam/rim BOUNDARY vertices of the SAME loop and collapses the seam; (2) **FINE deflection** (d ≤ 0.0075, all decline) — the annulus `trimmedFreeformMesh` CDT refinement densifies the interior (2736 verts at d=0.004) and the seam weld opens WHOLESALE (2119 open edges at z=c, mostly used-once) EVEN THOUGH the cap and annulus place BIT-IDENTICAL 301 seam-boundary vertices (301/301 exact match standalone) and NO pair is within tol — i.e. the dense interior CDT produces near-seam interior vertices the weld fuses onto the seam boundary as NON-MANIFOLD (used-3+) edges. MEASURED counter-tests that do NOT suffice: a uniform seam resample to `n≈circumference/(3·weldTol)` drives annulus close-pairs to ZERO at every deflection and fixes the COARSE regime but leaves the FINE-deflection wholesale seam open (still 21/40 land) — volume stays correct (rel ~1–2%) throughout, so this is purely a topology/weld failure, never a wrong solid. **The true enabler is a TOPOLOGY-AWARE weld** (never merge two vertices joined by a constrained boundary edge / two boundary vertices of one loop; never fuse an interior vertex onto a constrained-boundary vertex) OR a single canonical seam discretization SHARED as ONE curved edge node whose density tracks the deflection — both of which touch the BYTE-FROZEN M0 tessellator (`solid_mesher.h` `VertexWelder` / `face_mesher.h` CDT) with cross-cutting regression risk, so they CANNOT be landed byte-identically as a single additive slice this iteration. COMMON therefore continues to HONEST-DECLINE (`NotWatertight` → NULL → OCCT) at fragile deflections — never a leaky solid — which is the correct disciplined behavior.

OpenSpec `moat-m2c3-chain-seam-graph` validates --strict. **SHARPENED NEXT BLOCKER:** the 2-junction WALL SPLIT + strip WELD — a generalisation of `junction_split.h` (two interior valence-3 vertices) + `multi_face_weld.h` (a strip removal region + its box caps) — has both the closed-form strip oracle (landed here) and an OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_*` parity oracle, so it is verifiable without faking; the true branch-point (a valence-3 seam node where three arcs meet a single wall point) remains beyond it. **M2ff FREEFORM↔FREEFORM CLOSED-SEAM COMMON ✅ WELDS AT CLOSED-FORM (orientation-coherence fix + two-sided self-verify), CUT honest-declines — BOTH gates, native-vs-OCCT verified — the highest-value slice the M0w closed-seam pin newly unblocks:** one additive OCCT-free header-only verb `boolean/freeform_freeform_cut.h` (`freeformFreeformClosedSeamCut`) composes the WHOLE M2 substrate for TWO curved operands over a shared CLOSED curved seam — recognise[B1] BOTH operands → trace[M1] `A.wall∩B.wall` via two `makeBezierAdapter` surfaces (WLine keyed `(u1,v1)` on A, `(u2,v2)` on B) → split[B2 `splitFaceSmoothTrim`] BOTH walls (B's seam re-keyed `(u2,v2)→(u1,v1)`) → classify[B3 `classifyPointInMesh`] survivor membership vs the OTHER operand's mesh → weld[M0] + **orientation-coherence repair + two-sided volume self-verify** → NULL→OCCT on any decline. **ORIENTATION FIX:** the two survivor disk caps (A's, B's) each inherit their parent wall's orientation; A opens UP and B opens DOWN, so a naive weld is watertight (UNDIRECTED) but orientation-INCONSISTENT — its signed `enclosedVolume` was a locked 33.3% too small and did NOT converge. The verb now enforces the DIRECTED-edge invariant (`tess::isConsistentlyOriented`: every seam half-edge has exactly one reverse partner, 0 same-direction duplicates — the wrong shell had 1104), flipping exactly one cap so the lens is a coherent outward-normal boundary; if no single flip yields a consistent 2-manifold it DECLINES (never a leaky/inconsistent solid). **SELF-VERIFY HARDENED:** the freeform↔freeform self-verify is now TWO-SIDED — the welded volume must lie within a deflection-bounded band of the analytic op-volume (new `FfCutDecline::VolumeInconsistent`, additive), so a too-SMALL wrong volume can never be returned even for an unenumerated pose. Fixture: two coaxial paraboloid bowl-cups (UP bowl-cup `A` z=a·r² + top lid; DOWN dome-cup `B` z=H−a·r² + bottom lid), curved walls meeting in ONE CLOSED CIRCLE ρ=√(H/2a) at z=H/2; closed forms `V(A∩B)=π·H²/(4a)`, `V(A−B)=V(A)−that`. **GATE (a) HOST ANALYTIC (OCCT-free), `test_native_freeform_freeform_cut.cpp` 8/8:** both operands B1-admit (1 freeform wall + 1 lid each); the real M1 seam is CLOSED, radius ρ on BOTH walls' (u,v) to ~1e-13 and on both surfaces to the trace residual, at z*; each wall's B2 smooth-trim disk area = π·ρ²; the closed-form partition tiles exactly; **COMMON (the lens) WELDS watertight + consistently-oriented at the closed-form volume π·H²/(4a)=0.010053 and CONVERGES as deflection refines (rel err 12.4%→6.0%→3.4% across 0.01/0.005/0.0025 — the O(deflection) triangulation under-estimate of a smooth cap, NOT the orientation error), verified TWO-SIDED**; CUT HONEST-DECLINES to NULL (`ClassifyAmbiguous`, its apex-adjacent membership) across a deflection sweep — NEVER a leaky/wrong solid; non-operand → `NotAdmittedA`, non-intersecting → `SeamUnusable`. **GATE (b) SIM native-vs-OCCT (booted iOS sim), `native_freeform_freeform_cut_parity.mm` 14/14:** the SAME two bowl-cups reconstructed in OCCT (each `Geom_BezierSurface` bowl + a planar lid on the SHARED rim edges, sewn, interior-classified outward) — every native seam node lies ON BOTH OCCT Bézier surfaces (BRepExtrema ≤1e-4, measured 1.95e-15/2.21e-14); OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_Cut`=0.036990 (cf 0.037090, rel 0.3%) and `Common`=0.010053 (cf 0.010053, EXACT); the native COMMON welds and matches OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_Common`+`BRepGProp` within the deflection band (relErr 0.124→0.060→0.034, converging) while native CUT declines to NULL (correct honest fallthrough); a non-intersecting operand → native `SeamUnusable` + OCCT no-op. **PRIOR BLOCKER RESOLVED:** an earlier revision recorded the two-CURVED-side closed-seam weld as un-landable (open seam edges between two independently-tessellated curved caps). With the M0-rim tessellator weld in place the lens (A's disk cap ∪ B's disk cap) now welds watertight at the working deflections; what remained was an ORIENTATION bug (both caps inherit their parent wall's orientation, so the watertight shell was orientation-inconsistent and its signed volume 33.3% too small). That is fixed in the additive boolean layer (`freeform_freeform_cut.h` COMMON assembly: directed-edge orientation-coherence repair + `tess::isConsistentlyOriented` invariant, plus the two-sided volume self-verify) with NO tessellator change — so COMMON now WELDS at the closed-form volume and CUT honest-declines. **ZERO-REGRESSION:** `git diff include/` EMPTY (no `cc_*`); in `src/native` only `boolean/freeform_freeform_cut.h` (the COMMON orientation-coherence repair + two-sided volume self-verify + the new `VolumeInconsistent` reason) and `tessellate/mesh.h` (ADDITIVE `sameDirectionEdgeCount`/`isConsistentlyOriented` directed-edge checks — the existing `enclosedVolume`/`isWatertight`/`isTwoManifold` are UNTOUCHED) changed; both 0 OCCT includes; byte-frozen `smooth_trim_split.h` / B2 `face_split.h` / `freeform_operand.h` / `freeform_membership.h` / M0 tessellator (mesher/CDT/rim weld) / M1 / every landed boolean header UNCHANGED; full host `ctest` 62/62 GREEN + sim parity 14/14.

```

**Reading it (current front):** Wave 1's four launched tracks each banked a first verified slice,
so the concurrency front has advanced. **Runnable in parallel RIGHT NOW:** ▶ **M2** (freeform
booleans — `boolean/`) and ▶ **M4** (general import — `exchange/`), both unblocked by the M0
mesher; plus **M7a** (construct sweep/loft — independent, still unstarted); plus the continuing
asymptotic tracks **M1** breadth, **M5**, and **M6** — six disjoint modules, no shared code. The
freeform payoff chain remains the critical path: **M0 + M1 → M2 → M3** (booleans gate blends).
M5 (healing) and M6 (fuzzing) run the whole time and *gate the finish* (M4 quality, M8) rather
than the middle. M8 is terminal — only when every track is native at the bar and the M6 bar holds.

**Critical path (longest serial chain):** `M0 → M1↘ M2 → M3` (≈ 6–13 py end-to-end) — its first
link (M0 ↘ M1) is now past a first slice, so the live critical work is **M2 → M3**. Minimum
wall-clock to drop-OCCT is set by that chain + the asymptotic M5/M6 tails, not by total py,
because M4/M5/M6/M7 overlap it. Staffing M2 + M4 + M7a concurrently now is what compresses the
calendar next.

## Effort rollup (honest)

| | Person-years |
|---|---|
| **Delivered + verified vs OCCT (this project)** | ≈ **3.5–4.5 py** — planar/analytic breadth, SSI S1–S5 + S4-a…e, five curved-boolean families 3/3, curved fillet/chamfer (const/variable/asym), STEP export + broad import (all quadric+torus+general revolution, trimmed, assemblies, AP242-skip), shape-healing + STEP-import first slices, mismatched loft, deboss/polygon wrap-emboss |
| **Moat slices landed (this campaign)** | **M0** keystone mesher **+ M4/M4-rational/M4-tail-2/M4-tail-4** foreign B-spline STEP admission — surfaces + rational + curves + rectangular-trims + N-level nested assemblies + PMI census (**M4 import complete**) · **M0-weld** shared-curved-edge canonical placement (**freeform boolean now deflection-robust**) · **M1** freeform S4-d open-arm branch · **M2** substrate B1/B2/B3 + B4 -> **first freeform<->analytic boolean CUT+COMMON at BOTH gates** (sim vs BRepAlgoAPI_Cut, Hausdorff 1.6e-7) · **M5** gap-bridge + planar-cap · **M6** **SEVEN** fuzz domains (curved-boolean, STEP round-trip, construction, blend, wrap-emboss, mass-properties, **geometry-services** — GS3 distance / GS4 curvature / GS2 section incl. OBLIQUE / GS5 inertia / GS6 validity / GS1 HLR vs OCCT), all 0 DISAGREED · **M7a** N-section loft **+ M7-tail** guided-orient sweep (overturned M7a's decline) · **M-DM DM1** cc_split_plane · **M-GS GS3+GS4** measurement + curvature (both gates) **+ GS1** polyhedral HLR (both gates, cc_hlr_project) **+ GS5+GS6** native inertia tensor / principal moments (vs GProp_PrincipalProps) + B-rep validity checker cc_check_solid (vs BRepCheck_Analyzer::IsValid on valid + deliberately-broken fixtures, both gates) — each verified native-vs-OCCT, additive, src/native OCCT-free. Honest declines that sharpened the map: M2 first-attempt, guided-orient sweep (later overturned), M1-tail self-crossing (analytic proof), shared-sub-assembly, HLR curved silhouettes · **M2-FUSE first TWO-OPERAND freeform boolean (FUSE/CUT/COMMON, both gates, Hausdorff 7e-10 vs BRepAlgoAPI)** · **M-GS GS2** section curves + **GS5** inertia + **GS6** validity + **GS1-curved** cylinder/sphere HLR silhouettes (all vs OCCT) · fixed a real SSI oblique plane-cylinder ellipse bug (+regression) surfaced by GS2 |
| **Remaining — kernel geometry moat (M2/M3 breadth + tails + M8)** | ≈ **3–8 py** — **M2/M3 breadth** (freeform booleans/blends, bounded *per family*, the parallelizable bulk) + the **M5 + M6** asymptotic gates. M4 import is now essentially complete (B-spline surfaces + curves + rational + trims + nested assemblies + PMI census); M7 residuals small |
| **+ M-DM direct modeling (app-required, newly added)** | ≈ **1.5–3 py** — `cc_split_plane` (near-term, reuses the landed M2 half-space verb) + `cc_replace_face(_to_plane)` + project (push-pull / local B-rep re-solve; needs M2 + M3 + M5). NOT covered by any prior stage |
| **+ M-GS drafting/analysis geometry services (app-required, newly added)** | ≈ **2.5–5 py** — **GS1 HLR** (hidden-line removal for 2D drawings — the substantial one, hard blocker for OCCT-free drawings) + GS2 section curves + GS3 exact measurement + GS4 curvature. GS2/3/4 reuse landed native machinery; NOT covered by any prior stage |
| **➤ App fully OCCT-free — recomputed (this is what "the app uses our library without OCCT" costs)** | **Adopt native kernel (native + kernel's OCCT fallback — NOT OCCT-free):** ≈ **0.25–0.5 py** (swap the app's OCCT `KernelBridge.mm` for the CyberCadKernel lib). **Scoped OCCT-free** (app declares its supported domain, natively covers must-have booleans/blends/direct-modeling/**drawings+measurement** + declines exotic freeform, IGES dropped or thin OCCT shim): ≈ **8–15 py**. **Full-native OCCT-free** (every input OCCT handles today — arbitrary freeform booleans/blends, robust arbitrary-broken healing, native IGES): ≈ **14–27 py + the asymptotic M5/M6 tails** (never fully "closes") |
| **Note — the CAD *app* layer is separate** | The above is the **geometry-kernel** cost. CyberCad's "SolidWorks on iPad" value — sketcher/constraint solver (planegcs), parametric feature history, multi-body/mates/IK, drawing/annotation system, datums, patterns, document/persistence, Metal rendering + Pencil UX — is an **app-layer body of work OCCT never provided**, mostly already built/in-flight, and **orthogonal to drop-occt** |
| IGES (app uses `cc_iges_import/export`) | **DECISION: DROPPED** (product decision). IGES is *not* reimplemented natively; `cc_iges_*` is removed/stubbed at `drop-occt`. The app is STEP-first; IGES interop, if ever needed, is an optional OCCT-linked plugin outside the OCCT-free core. **0 native py; removes IGES from the drop-occt critical items.** |

## The remaining path to `drop-occt` (M8) — projection once the M2 substrate closes

*Projection as of the M2-substrate round (B1 in flight; B2 + B3 landed). Once B1 lands, the
freeform-boolean **assembly** is reachable and the hard **research** is largely behind — what
remains to actually unlink OCCT is **breadth** (parallelizable) plus **two asymptotic gates** that
must HOLD, not new keystones.*

What the campaign has closed: the **keystone** (M0 mesher), its **import surface** (M4 non-rational
+ M4-rational B-spline admission — foreign trimmed B-spline patches now import native end-to-end),
and the **M2 substrate** (B1 recognise · B2 split · B3 classify, over M1 trace + M0 weld). The
freeform-boolean chain's *enablers* are done; the *payoff breadth* is what's ahead.

| Remaining stage | What's left to be native at the bar | Bounded / Asymptotic | Needs | Parallel? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **M2 breadth** | freeform booleans across families: NURBS↔NURBS, all 3 ops, **multi-face / holed / multi-branch-seam** splits (first slice reachable once B1 lands; breadth ahead) | bounded *per family*, asymptotic in full generality | substrate (B1+B2+B3) | assembly serial; **families parallelize** |
| **M3** blends + wrap-emboss | curved-curved fillets/chamfers + wrap-emboss on **freeform bases** | bounded per family | **M2** | after M2; families parallel |
| **M4 tail** | ~~rational-*curve* trims~~ **LANDED** (M4-tail-2, combined `RATIONAL_B_SPLINE_CURVE` edge/trim admission, verified vs OCCT, SIM parity 90/90) · AP242 **PMI semantics** · ~~deep-nested rigid/conformal assemblies~~ **LANDED** (Form-A CDSR chain walk, verified vs OCCT) · `MAPPED_ITEM` (Form-B) still deferred | bounded (parser breadth) | M0 ✅ | ✅ **now** (`exchange/`) |
| **M5 tail** | self-intersecting-wire repair · pcurve reconstruction · **arbitrary broken industrial B-rep** | **ASYMPTOTIC** (`ShapeFix` moat) | — | ✅ **now** (`heal/`) |
| **M6 bar** | fuzz the remaining domains (blends, healing) + **HOLD** zero-silent-wrong across the whole surface | **ASYMPTOTIC** — the *gate*, never "done" | tracks it guards | ✅ **now** (test infra) |
| **M7 tail** | ~~guided-sweep orientation law~~ ✅ (M7-tail) · ~~curved-rail morph~~ ✅ + ~~real-twist sweep~~ ✅ (M7t) · fine-pitch thread (M7b) | bounded-ish | fine-pitch needs M2 | mostly LANDED (`construct/`) |
| **M8** `drop-occt` | delete `src/engine/occt` · drop the OCCT link · stub `cc_iges_*` | terminal | **ALL native at the bar + M6 holds** | terminal, single |

**Why M8 is a decision, not a date.** Even once every capability is native, OCCT is not unlinked on
the day the last feature lands. **M5 (healing robustness) and M6 (the completeness fuzzing bar) are
the gate.** OCCT stays the labelled oracle + fallback until the M6 differential fuzzers demonstrate
*zero silent wrong results across the entire native surface* — the moment the fallback is provably
unnecessary for the supported domain. M6-breadth already proved the bar's worth by catching OCCT
itself mis-importing shallow frustums (native vindicated by closed-form). The research walls are
mostly behind; what remains is **breadth you can parallelize** and **two gates that must hold**.

## Honest framing

- **M0 was the highest-leverage single target** — the recurring blocker under freeform booleans,
  blends, wrap-emboss, and foreign STEP import. It is now **complete end-to-end**: the mesher plus
  the STEP-reader admission (landed as M4 / M4-rational, verified vs OCCT `BRepMesh`). Foreign
  trimmed B-spline patches import native.
- **M2/M3 are the payoff.** The M2 *substrate* is (all but) done — **B2** (split) and **B3**
  (classify) landed, **B1** (recognise) in flight — so the freeform-boolean **assembly** is the
  next critical-path target, then breadth per family. They are bounded per surface family and
  asymptotic only in full arbitrary generality.
- **M5 and M6 are why `drop-occt` (#8) is a long-horizon direction, not a date.** They are
  asymptotic by nature (arbitrary broken input, sub-resolution completeness); a first robust
  slice is bankable, the guarantee is re-earned continuously. OCCT stays the labelled oracle
  and fallback until the M6 bar demonstrates the fallback is unnecessary for the supported
  domain — never removed on faith.
- Every stage ships the same way the landed tiers did: **a narrow verified slice + an explicit
  OCCT-oracle gate + an honest fallback**, one capability at a time.
