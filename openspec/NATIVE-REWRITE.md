# Phase 4 â Native Rewrite Sub-Roadmap (drop OCCT)

The endgame: replace the OCCT adapter with **native C++20**, one capability at a
time, until OCCT can be unlinked entirely. This sub-roadmap sequences that work
and fixes the rules every capability migration follows.

Committed goal: **full drop-OCCT**, including native booleans. Honest caveat:
robust B-rep booleans and shape healing are research-grade â they will land
*progressively hardened and verified against OCCT*, not production-robust on day
one. Difficulty is flagged per capability below.

**Where this stands now (honest ceiling).** The tractable native slice of every
capability #1â#7 is DONE at the verification bar â including the native STEP EXPORT
slice AND the first native STEP IMPORT slice (#7). Phase 4 is therefore **COMPLETE AT ITS ACHIEVABLE NATIVE CEILING, not
fully drop-OCCT**: #8 `drop-occt` is BLOCKED because two hard dependencies remain
research-grade multi-year efforts â (1) a general robust curved boolean / blend
kernel (arbitrary surface-surface intersection + shape healing) and (2) native
a FULL native STEP IMPORT (the native reader covers the elementary/B-spline
subset the writer produces, foreign OCCT-written box/cylinder, flat multi-solid
compounds, single-level RIGID/UNIFORM-SCALE/MIRROR placed assemblies, AP242
geometry with PMI skipped, TRIMMED_CURVE edges over an in-slice basis
(LINE/CIRCLE/ELLIPSE/B-spline — the B-spline basis honoring its knot-span trims),
AND a SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION reducing to the matching native analytic quadric per its
generatrix — a straight LINE ∥ axis → an exact native CYLINDER, an OBLIQUE line meeting
the axis → a native CONE (apex on axis, half-angle from the line-axis angle), a line ⟂ axis
→ a native PLANE annulus cap (all three import NATIVELY, watertight, at OCCT parity within
faceting tol), plus an on-axis CIRCLE/arc → SPHERE reduction — including a FULL sphere: OCCT
writes a whole sphere as ONE SPHERICAL_SURFACE (or the on-axis-circle SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION
form) ADVANCED_FACE bounded by a VERTEX_LOOP (a single degenerate pole vertex, NO seam/pole
EDGE_CURVEs — a bare periodic surface); the reader now maps that VERTEX_LOOP bound to a
native Sphere face with a NULL outer wire, which the tessellator meshes over its natural
(u∈[0,2π], v∈[−π/2,π/2]) bounds — welding the longitude seam + both poles → a WATERTIGHT
Sphere solid at OCCT parity (sim: native parsed=1, ΔV≈2.7e-3; the STEP-import sim now `[NIMPORT]` 77/77). A
VERTEX_LOOP bound on any NON-sphere surface, or a partial spherical zone carrying real trim
edges that cannot close, keeps the honest OCCT deferral — schema-independent, AP203/AP214/AP242
headers all accepted. A full **TOROIDAL_SURFACE** (and the off-axis-circle SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION OCCT
emits as one) now imports NATIVELY watertight as an additive `FaceSurface::Kind::Torus` (bare
doubly-periodic surface, both seams welded, no pole — sim `native torus` ΔV≈2.68e-3 vs OCCT, V=2π²Rr²;
the Torus mesh path reuses the sphere bare-periodic path additively, so `face_mesher.h`/`trim.h` are
untouched and every existing mesh is byte-identical). A GENERAL **SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION** — an **ELLIPSE**
or a (non-rational) **B_SPLINE_CURVE** generatrix that touches the axis at both ends — now also imports
NATIVELY watertight: the reader revolves the profile meridian into the exact RATIONAL tensor-product
B-spline (Piegl & Tiller A7.1 — u = the standard rational-quadratic full circle, 9 poles/weights
{1,1/√2,…}; v = the ellipse promoted to two exact rational-quadratic 90° arcs, or the B-spline profile
used directly) and stores it as an additive `FaceSurface::Kind::BSpline` face WITH weights, meshed as a
bare periodic surface over its natural (u∈[0,2π], v=profile) bounds (u-seam welded, both axis poles
collapsed) — the UNMODIFIED tessellator's existing rational eval + sphere-style bare-periodic path, so
`face_mesher.h`/`surface_eval.h`/`trim.h` stay untouched and every existing mesh is byte-identical (sim
`revolution→ellipsoid` ΔV≈4.5e-3 vs OCCT, V=4/3·π·b²·a; `revolution→bspline` ΔV≈2.6e-3). Still an honest
DECLINE → OCCT: non-uniform/shear transforms, deep-nested assemblies, PMI SEMANTICS, a PARTIAL/trimmed
torus, and a SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION with no faithful native kind — a tilted/off-axis ellipse, a rational
STEP profile, a SKEW oblique line (hyperboloid) — plus foreign arbitrary-rational B-spline surfaces and
general swept/bounded/offset surfaces still fall back to OCCT). **IGES import/export are DESCOPED
(STEP-only interchange): no native IGES will be built; the `cc_iges_*` ABI stays
OCCT-backed until `drop-occt`, then removed/stubbed, never reimplemented.** Until both
the curved kernel and general STEP import exist, OCCT stays linked.

## Method (locked)

- **Clean-room from references.** Implement from math/first-principles, public
  algorithm references (e.g. *The NURBS Book* â de Boor, de Casteljau, basis
  functions; standard computational-geometry literature), and the `cc_*`
  contract. **OCCT source is a reference *oracle*** â consulted to confirm an
  algorithm matches and to compare numerics/perf â not copied verbatim. License
  is not a constraint on this project; the driver is modern, maintainable,
  fast C++20.
- **Balance maintainability Â· readability Â· performance.** Prefer clear,
  well-named, `constexpr`/`span`/`concepts`-friendly C++20 with documented
  algorithms and low cognitive complexity (systems band â¤ 25â35 for irreducible
  geometry, flagged). Optimise with data (benchmarks), not guesswork.

## Verification model (every capability)

Native code has **no OCCT dependency**, which gives two independent test gates:

1. **Host unit tests** â native code compiles and unit-tests with `clang++`
   `-std=c++20` (no OCCT, no simulator): analytic/known-value assertions
   (a known BÃ©zier point, a transform identity, an exact volume).
2. **Simulator native-vs-OCCT parity** â on the iOS simulator (OCCT linked), the
   native result is compared against the **OCCT oracle** at sampled inputs within
   a tight tolerance (fp64 for exact modelling). OCCT reference source lives at
   `/Users/leonardoaraujo/work/OCCT/src` (V8.0).

A capability is **migrated** only when: host unit tests pass, native-vs-OCCT
parity passes on the simulator, **and every existing suite stays green**
(`run-sim-suite.sh` 221/221, host CTest, GPU/Phase-3 suites). Then the engine's
active implementation for that capability is switched native, OCCT kept as a
fallback/oracle until the whole phase completes, and OCCT is unlinked only at
the final `drop-occt` step.

## Architecture

Native code lands under `src/native/` (host-buildable, OCCT-free). A
`NativeEngine : IEngine` implements each capability as it matures and **falls
through to the OCCT engine** for capabilities not yet native (the coexistence the
engine-adapter was built for) â so the app keeps working throughout, behind the
unchanged `cc_*` facade.

```
cc_* facade â active engine
                ââ NativeEngine (C++20)  ââ implements migrated capabilities
                â        ââ falls through to â for the rest
                ââ OcctEngine            ââ oracle + fallback (unlinked at the end)
```

Verified vs a DUAL oracle: the analytic inclusion-exclusion closed form (engine `ssiCurvedBooleanVerified` COMMON arm + generic `booleanResultVerified` `V(A)±…` for FUSE/CUT with native `buildConeCylCommon` as `V(A∩B)`, same 1% deflection-bounded tol as the Steinmetz `16 R³/3` oracle) AND OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_{Common,Fuse,Cut}` (sim): COMMON volN=19.107 vs analytic 19.111355 vs OCCT 19.111 (ΔV=2.03e-04, ΔA=9.89e-05); FUSE volN=41.618 vs analytic 41.62610 vs OCCT 41.626 (ΔV=2.04e-04, ΔA=1.13e-04); CUT volN=13.349 vs analytic 13.35177 vs OCCT 13.352 (ΔV=2.03e-04, ΔA=1.02e-04), watertight/closed/valid, no tolerance weakened. The reversed `cyl−cone` CUT, transversal (non-coaxial) / apex-crossing cone pairs, and cone∩cone all decline → NULL → OCCT. **S5-f** extends the CONE family to the coaxial cone(frustum)∩sphere op-set (COMMON + FUSE + CUT): a shared `coneSphereSetup` prologue gates one `Cone` + one `Sphere` with its centre ON the cone axis on the FRUSTUM side, so `intersectSphereConeCoaxial` (a QUADRATIC) gives EXACTLY ONE interior crossing `s*` that does NOT cross the apex (`nearTangentGaps==0`, `curveCount==1`), resampled to ONE pooled ring; the cone side reuses the S5-e cone-wall split (`appendRevolvedBand` + `appendDiskCap`), the sphere side the sphere-lens cap builder (`appendSphereCap`, inner/outer apex + reversed flags). `buildConeSphereCommon` welds the cone band inside the sphere + the cone disc + the sphere INNER cap (`V=V_frustum+V_spherical-segment`); `buildConeSphereFuse` (A∪B) keeps the sphere OUTER cap + the cone OUTER wall + the cone disc (`V=V(A)+V(B)−V(A∩B)`, a GROW); `buildConeSphereCut` (A−B, cone minuend, order-sensitive) keeps A's outer wall + A's disc(s) + the sphere INNER cap emitted REVERSED — a CONNECTED frustum-with-spherical-dimple (`V=V(A)−V(A∩B)`, a SHRINK). Verified vs a DUAL oracle (engine `ssiCurvedBooleanVerified` COMMON arm + generic `booleanResultVerified` for FUSE/CUT with native `buildConeSphereCommon` as `V(A∩B)`, same 1% tol) AND OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_{Common,Fuse,Cut}`: COMMON volN=5.2546 vs OCCT 5.2558 (ΔV=2.41e-04, ΔA=1.28e-04); FUSE volN=60.686 vs OCCT 60.718 (ΔV=5.22e-04, ΔA=2.61e-04); CUT (cone−sphere) volN=27.202 vs OCCT 27.207 (ΔV=1.96e-04, ΔA=1.34e-04). The sphere-minuend `sphere−cone` CUT, the TWO-circle crossing (sphere through the cone / spanning the apex), apex-crossing / apex-in-extent frustums, and TRANSVERSAL (non-coaxial) cone∩sphere (a quartic space curve) all decline → NULL → OCCT (`add-native-cone-sphere-boolean` archived `2026-07-07`). **S5-c FUSE/CUT** reuse one generalised `appendSphereCap(outer,reversed)`: FUSE (A∪B) = the two OUTER (far-pole) caps welded on the shared seam (`V=V(A)+V(B)−lens`); CUT (A−B, order-sensitive) = the OUTER cap of A + the INNER cap of B emitted REVERSED (inward normal, bounding the scooped cavity) (`V=V(A)−lens`) — verified vs BOTH the analytic closed forms AND OCCT (FUSE ΔV 6.5e-04 eq / 8.3e-04 uneq; CUT ΔV 7.0e-04 eq / 9.3e-04 uneq); the COMMON path is byte-identical (defaults `outer=false,reversed=false`); tangent/containment/concentric pairs decline → NULL → OCCT. **S5-d** is the branched-trace op-set (COMMON / FUSE / CUT): on the S4 decline edge, a `steinmetzPreGate` (equal-R, orthogonal, crossing cylinders) triggers a branch-enabled re-trace, `recogniseSteinmetzTrace` accepts only the canonical 2-branch-point / 4-`BranchArc` structure, and the shared lune/arc split + `VertexPool` weld drive all three ops: `buildSteinmetzCommon` welds the four inside-the-other lunes (`V = 16 R³/3`); `buildSteinmetzFuse` keeps both cylinders' OUTSIDE walls + all four caps (`V=V(A)+V(B)−V(common)`); `buildSteinmetzCut` keeps A's OUTSIDE wall + A's caps + B's lunes REVERSED (`V=V(A)−V(common)`). Verified vs **BOTH** the exact analytic inclusion-exclusion volumes (host) **and** OCCT `BRepAlgoAPI_{Common,Fuse,Cut}` (sim), all watertight/closed/valid inside the 1% bar, no tolerance weakened: COMMON volN = 5.3287, ΔV = 8.75e-04 (−0.088%); FUSE volN = 32.385 vs OCCT 32.366, ΔV = 5.82e-04; CUT volN = 13.526 vs OCCT 13.516, ΔV = 7.22e-04. A disjoint Steinmetz pair (no seam) declines → NULL → OCCT for all three ops (sphere∩sphere FUSE/CUT are also native — see S5-c above). S4-a/b classification + S4-c near-tangent march-through + **S4-d branch-point slice** (the Steinmetz self-crossing bicylinder localized + routed through both branch points vs OCCT `IntPatch`/`GeomAPI_IntSS` — 2 branch pts, 4 arms → 2 crossing ellipses; isolated tangent point still ends; `add-native-ssi-s4d-branch-points` archived) + **S4-e chart-singularity slice** (a marched curve crossing a sphere parametric pole `v=±π/2` or a cone apex — where ONE surface's own `(u,v)` degenerates while its point+normal stay finite — now FULLY traced vs OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS`: sphere great circle `singX=2 len 6.2829 vs 6.2832`, cone apex `singX=1` both nappes, on-surface ≤ 1.5e-07; `add-native-ssi-s4e-singularities` archived `2026-07-05`). **S4-f COMPLETENESS + LOOP-ROBUSTNESS slice** (hardens curves already traced, adds no new capability): loop-closure is now a TRUE-RETURN test (return to seed AND tangent-continuous AND arc past the closure window) so a near-pass no longer FALSE-CLOSES; a self-intersection guard detects + traces THROUGH a single-arm figure-eight crossing as typed data (`branchPts=0`, distinct from S4-d); an adaptive completeness-critic re-seed recovers small loops the fixed 1/32 subdivision misses (fixture A recall 0.50→1.00 floor 1/128, adversarial many-loops D 0.25→1.00 floor 1/48, both vs OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS`, every recovered node on both surfaces ≤ 1e-11) — **completeness is MEASURED per-fixture at the reached floor, NOT a proof (below ANY fixed resolution a smaller loop can still be missed); S4-f RAISES the recall floor and de-risks (does NOT unblock) curved blends #6 + wrap-emboss #7**; `add-native-ssi-s4f-completeness` archived `2026-07-05`. Remaining: **S4 general/freeform branch points + general/freeform + higher-order-cusp singularities + S4-f general small-loop residual (below the reached floor) + self-intersection arc-splitting/topology repair** + wider S5 coverage (general non-Steinmetz branched pairs, transversal/apex cone pairs + cone∩cone + the two-circle / apex-crossing / transversal cone∩sphere crossings, more curved-curved families — the equal-R orthogonal Steinmetz op-set is COMPLETE 3/3, and the CONE family's coaxial cone∩cylinder AND coaxial cone∩sphere single-crossing op-sets are now COMPLETE 3/3 native (COMMON/FUSE/CUT))).
| 6 | `add-native-fillets-offsets` | `native-blends` | hard | `BRepFilletAPI`, `BRepOffsetAPI` |

| 8 | `drop-occt` | â | â | unlink OCCT; kernel fully native |

Booleans (#5) are the hardest and longest-lived OCCT dependency â sequenced late
and expected to iterate. The PLANAR-polyhedron slice is now native (BSP-CSG,
self-verified EXACT vs OCCT on axis-aligned boxes); curved / general booleans remain
OCCT-backed. #7 (STEP/IGES) may stay a thin external dependency
longest; a native exchange is lower priority than the modelling core.

- â **#4 `native-construction`** â **CORE done at the verification bar; advanced
  swept solids are a follow-up (`#4b`).** The first **engine-wired** capability. Two
  construction ops are native: `cc_solid_extrude` (closed polygon â prism: bottom/top
  `Plane` caps + one planar quad `Plane` side per profile edge) and `cc_solid_revolve`
  for **LINE-SEGMENT** profiles (per-segment surface of revolution â parallelâ`Cylinder`,
  perpendicularâ`Plane`, obliqueâ`Cone`; full 360Â° closes the shell, partial angle adds

  interception. No regressions (host CTest 12/12, `run-sim-suite.sh` 221/221 re-verified
  against a freshly rebuilt SIMULATORARM64 slice). Documented representational difference
  (not a geometric mismatch): the native builder emits per-face edges / per-patch vertices
  (edge/vertex SHARING deferred) and tiles a full-turn surface of revolution into < Ï
  angular patches (periodic-face construction deferred), so native V/E and the full-turn
  face count differ from OCCT's shared/periodic representation while the SOLID is
  geometrically identical. See [`docs/STATUS-phase-4.md`](../docs/STATUS-phase-4.md);

    (sim OCCT parity) GREEN: `native_construct_profiles_parity.mm` through the cc_*

    line+arc / line-revolve tube / on-axis-arc-revolve sphere) match the OCCT oracle
    (planar EXACT; curved deflection-bounded vol rel â¤ 5.0e-2, all watertight; native

    spline extrude, off-axis-circle â torus revolve) transparently delegate to OCCT
    (vol rel 0.00e+00). Note: `splineXYCount` on the kind-3 side-channel is the number
    of DOUBLES (2Ã the point count), matching the OCCT `addSplineEdge` bounds guard â
    now documented in `cc_kernel.h`. **Tier B (2-section ruled loft):** Gate 1 (host,
    no OCCT) GREEN â `test_native_loft` (9 cases: prism / frustum / twisted rotated
    square / two-3D-wire triangle prism / tilted planar section watertight, + deferred

    NOW NATIVE (engine-wired behind the same `cc_set_engine(1)` toggle):
    `cc_solid_sweep` for (a) a **STRAIGHT** spine (exact directional prism, vol =
    profileArea Ã |d|) and (b) a **SMOOTH CURVED but PLANAR** spine. The crux â and the
    fix that made Gate 2 pass â is the FRAME LAW: the OCCT oracle
    `BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipe` uses `GeomFill_CorrectedFrenet`, which for a **planar** spine
    collapses to a **constant rotation** (`GeomFill_CorrectedFrenet.cxx`, `isPlanar` â
    `Law_Constant`), i.e. it TRANSLATES the section with a FIXED orientation, NOT a
    perpendicular-tracking sweep. So `src/native/construct/sweep.h` holds the start frame
    CONSTANT across stations (`detail::constantFrames`), builds one bilinear ruled band
    per (profile edge Ã spine segment) with shared per-station rings, and caps both ends
    in the fixed section plane â a watertight solid. (An earlier RMF / parallel-transport
    revision kept the section perpendicular and produced the Pappus arc-length volume â
    geometrically "nicer" but a REAL mismatch vs the oracle, correctly rejected by the
    parity gate; we match the oracle.) `cc_twisted_sweep` is native ONLY when it reduces
    to the plain sweep (twist â 0, scale â 1 â forwards to `build_sweep`). Gate 1 green:
    host `test_native_sweep` (11 cases â straight prism / collinear-collapse / arbitrary-
    3D-direction / pentagon / zero-twist prism / smooth-planar-arc watertight + constant-
    frame volume `AÂ·|ÎspineÂ·nÌ|` / constant-frame invariance / degenerate + real-twist +

    (guarded by `spineTooSharp`), a **real-twist/scale** `cc_twisted_sweep` (OCCT
    `ThruSections`), and the pipe-shell/guide cases **`cc_guided_sweep`** /
    **`cc_loft_along_rail`** (engine-glue fall-through). Gate 2 (sim OCCT parity) GREEN:
    `tests/sim/native_sweep_parity.mm` + `scripts/run-sim-native-sweep.sh` through the
    `cc_*` facade under `cc_set_engine(0/1)` â **`[NSWEEP]` 11 passed / 0 failed**: the

    n=330.299 **rel 1.7e-16**, bbox maxCornerÎ 1.0e-7, native F = OCCT F = 98, watertight),
    plus the three deferred cases (real-twist / guided / loft-rail) delegating to OCCT
    (vol rel 0.00e+00, native active â fall-through proof). On `run-sim-suite.sh`'s SKIP
    list (own `main()`), 221-assertion count unchanged. No regressions (host CTest 15/15,
    `run-sim-suite.sh` 221/221). Living change: `openspec/changes/add-native-sweep`.
  - **â `#4b` Tier D (threads / tapered shank) â ALL THREE NATIVE at the Gate-1 bar:
    `cc_tapered_shank`, `cc_helical_thread`, `cc_tapered_thread`.** Engine-wired behind
    the same `cc_set_engine(1)` toggle. **`cc_tapered_shank`** â a pointed-shank silhouette
    (cone tip â full-radius cylinder â head disk) revolved 360Â° about Z by REUSING the
    already-parity-verified native revolve (`build_revolution`, construct.h). The tip is
    a TRUE on-axis apex (the revolve collapses its angular copies to one shared vertex, so
    no sliver breaks the weld â a non-zero tip radius does NOT weld, verified), giving a
    ROBUSTLY watertight solid at every deflection {0.05â¦0.005} with volume
    `âÏ rÂ²Â·taperHeight + Ï rÂ²Â·fullHeight` within the deflection bound (r5/fh20/th10 â
    exact 1832.6, meshed 1828â1832), matching `BRepPrimAPI_MakeRevol`. Built in
    `src/native/construct/thread.h` (OCCT-FREE, host-buildable, all four functions
    cognitive complexity ð¢ Excellent â¤ 5). **`cc_helical_thread` / `cc_tapered_thread`
    (NOW NATIVE):** the full radial-V helical tiling â a V/triangular section transported
    RADIALLY along the pitch-line helix via the AXIS auxiliary-spine law
    (radial = (cosÎ¸,sinÎ¸,0), axial = +Z, so the V does NOT Frenet-rotate â mirroring
    `BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell::SetMode(axisWire,true)`), tiled into three bilinear ruled
    bands per span (loft.h `ruledSideFace`) with shared per-station rings + two planar V
    end caps, capped at `samplesPerTurn â [8,24]` and GUARDED against self-intersection
    (pitch-line radius must clear the axis at both ends; `2Â·halfBase â¤ pitch`; degenerate
    params â NULL). **The per-turn seam WELD was the last blocker and is now fixed at the
    mesher level (topology-preferred, geometry untouched):** the ruled-band â band and
    band â V-cap seams are STRAIGHT edges shared by two faces that each evaluated the seam
    through their OWN bilinear surface, so the two boundary points agreed only to ~1 ULP;
    when a shared coordinate landed on a spatial-weld cell boundary (coordÂ·âtol = k+0.5)
    the ULP twins rounded to opposite cells and the weld left the seam OPEN at isolated
    deflections. The mesher now emits, for every straight boundary edge, CANONICAL seam
    points â interpolated at the shared sample indices `i/n` between the edge's two
    BOUNDING VERTICES in a fixed lexicographic order (`edge_mesher.h` `CanonicalEndpoints`
    / `face_mesher.h` `recordEdgeAnchors`), which is BIT-IDENTICAL for the two coincident
    edges regardless of build order â and SNAPS each seam-lying vertex to its canonical
    point (`BoundaryAnchors`). The two faces therefore place the identical 3D point and the
    conservative single-cell weld fuses them, with NO widening of the merge radius (which
    would over-collapse a fine curvature grid). This is exactly the "one shared 1D
    discretization pinned on both faces" contract, completed at the 3D-point level; the V
    volume/geometry are unchanged. Result: helical (major6â¦20 / pitch2â¦4 / turns1â¦5 /
    depth0.5â¦1.5 / spt8â¦24) and tapered (top5â¦8 / tip3â¦4 / â¦) are ROBUSTLY watertight
    (`boundaryEdges==0`) at EVERY deflection in the `robustlyWatertight` ladder across the
    full swept parameter space (432/432 helical + 96/96 tapered candidates â native), so
    the engine keeps them NATIVE. **HONESTY (unchanged guard):** a FINE-PITCH /
    self-intersecting thread (turns fold through each other, e.g. major2/pitch0.2/depth3)
    still fails `robustlyWatertight` â a self-overlapping mesh is non-manifold no matter
    how the vertices weld â so it still FALLS THROUGH to the OCCT `MakePipeShell` oracle
    (labelled, verified, never faked; the native builder never emits the round-profile
    fallback). Gate 1 (host, no OCCT) GREEN â `test_native_thread` (9 cases: shank watertight+volume,
    shank ppmÂ³ scaling, shank degenerate NULL, `helical_thread_is_watertight_across_ladder`
    + `tapered_thread_is_watertight_across_ladder` â a HARD requirement asserting
    `boundaryEdges==0` at EVERY deflection in the ladder {0.1,0.05,0.02,0.01} with the right
    V-tiling face count, positive volume sign and turn count, degenerate-params NULL,

    tapered thread now run NATIVE through the facade with valid watertight mass-properties;
    `native_fine_pitch_thread_falls_through_to_default` â the self-intersecting thread still
    defers to the fallback); host CTest 18/18, all native suites green
    (`test_native_construct/profile/loft/sweep/tessellate/boolean/blend/topology/thread`).
    The seam-weld fix is exercised directly by `test_native_thread` (both helical + tapered

    the old `size mismatch → NULL` guard in `build_ruled_loft_sections`
    (`src/native/construct/loft.h`) is replaced by `detail::equalizeSectionCounts` — both

    The EQUAL-count path is byte-identical (short-circuited). `NativeEngine::solid_loft` /

    Four levers: **(1) fixed-plane-cut corrector** — inside the band the S3 along-`t`
    advance residual (`t = normalize(nA×nB)` ill-conditions as `sine → 0`) is replaced by a
    cut on the plane perpendicular to the **last-good forward tangent `t★`**, so the
    `least_squares` solve stays well-posed where the local surface tangent degenerates;
    **(2) curvature-aware predictor** — bends `P + h·t★` by the discrete two-node curvature
    so the corrector starts in-basin across the sharp bend; **(3) fine deflection-bounded
    step** through the low-sine band (capped `h₀/16`, `minStep` floor, `crossMaxSteps`
    budget) so it RESOLVES the region rather than leaping it; **(4) crossable gate (honesty
    core)** — crosses ONLY a `NearTangentTransversal` single-branch graze; a steep-sine-
    collapse witness (stall sine < ¼ last-good) OR a band-minimum-floor scan (fine
    look-ahead min sine < `0.3·tangentSinTol`) forces a DEFER, so a branch saddle / genuine
    `TangentPoint`/`TangentCurve`/`Undecided` STILL stops + classifies + defers → OCCT. No
    point is fabricated past a degeneracy: a crossed arc is emitted only if EVERY node
    verified on both surfaces ≤ `onSurfTol`, else the whole arc is discarded (rollback).
    **At the bar:** a sphere grazed by an offset cylinder that S3 TRUNCATES at
    `tangentSinTol=0.25` now traces the FULL closed loop (`nearTangentGaps → 0`,
    `nearTangentCrossed = 22` nodes, every node on both surfaces ≤ 1e-6, crossed arc on the

    orthogonal-cylinder **saddle (a branch crossing) STILL DEFERS** (`nearTangentCrossed=0`,
    `nearTangentGaps ≥ 1`), as do genuine `TangentPoint`/`TangentCurve` contacts. All 5 S3
    transversal fixtures trace bit-identically (corrector/step outside the band unchanged).

    fabricated B). **(2) ENUMERATE ARMS** — build the shared tangent-plane basis at B, form
    the relative second fundamental form `H = II_A − II_B`, solve the tangent-cone quadratic:
    discriminant `Δ > 0` ⇒ TWO distinct real tangent lines ⇒ up to four world-space rays;
    `Δ ≤ 0` ⇒ EMPTY (definite ⇒ isolated `TangentPoint`, END; double root ⇒ cusp, out of
    scope, DEFER). **Never fabricates a ray** — the same discriminant sign as S4-b's
    `TangentPoint` classification enforces "an isolated tangent point still ends". **(3)
    ROUTE** — step `h₀/8` off B along each real ray, S4-c-correct back onto both surfaces,
    then run the normal S3 walk to termination; drop the arm if `S₀` fails on-both-surfaces
    or the march makes no progress. **(4) ASSEMBLE** — dedup arms that retrace a kept arm
    (`retraces`), merge their shared branch-point connectivity into the `BranchNode`
    (`point`, `branchSine`, `armLineIds`), `++branchPoints`. A branch not robustly
    localizable/enumerable/routable STOPS + defers **exactly as S4-c** (a `NearTangent` WLine
    in `nearTangentGaps`). **At the bar:** the **Steinmetz bicylinder** (two equal-R=1
    orthogonal cylinders) that S3+S4-c TRUNCATE at the saddle (one `NearTangent` WLine,
    `branchPoints=0`) is now FULLY traced: `branchPoints=2` localized at `(0,±1,0)` (branch
    sine ≈ 5e-8 / 9e-8, re-projection residual ≈ 5e-13), 4 `BranchArc` arms assembled into
    the two crossing ellipses, `nearTangentGaps=0`, every node on both cylinders ≤ `onSurfTol`;
    sim parity vs OCCT `eq-cyl s4d branchPts=2 traced=4 arms=3 onCurve=1.74e-6 onSurf=1.07e-8`
    (both branch points match the OCCT saddles at `(0,±1,0)`). The isolated `TangentPoint`
    (spheres `d=R₁+R₂`) STILL ENDS with zero arms; the S4-c graze still crosses
    (`crossed=22`); the flag-off eq-cyl control still defers; the 5 transversal pairs stay
    `nt=0` bit-identical. Both gates green: host `test_native_ssi_marching` (**12 cases, 0
    failed**; NUMSCI OFF CTest **26/26**, NUMSCI ON **31/31**) + sim
    `scripts/run-sim-native-ssi-s4d.sh` (**8 passed, 0 failed**). No regressions (S5
    `native-pass=5` persists, tessellator byte-identical, `src/native/**` OCCT-free).
    **Honest scope — what S4-d does NOT do:** only the elementary two-real-distinct-line
    **transversal self-crossing** (Steinmetz family) is traced; general/freeform branch
    points, three-plus tangent lines, cusps (double root) and S4-f self-intersection
    completeness DEFER → OCCT, reported with the measured gap, never faked (the **S4-e chart

    below). **Steinmetz is now unblocked** natively. Files: `src/native/ssi/branch_point.h` +

  - **SSI Stage S4-e (CHART SINGULARITIES — analytic sphere pole + cone apex, and the FREEFORM
    NURBS collapsed-row pole) — TWO HONEST SLICES DONE at the verification bar (both gates);
    the curve cusp declined by IFT.** A **chart (removable) singularity** is where
    ONE surface's own `(u,v)` parametrization degenerates (`‖dU‖ → 0`) while its 3D point +
    normal stay finite — a **sphere parametric pole** (`v = ±π/2`) or a **cone apex** (signed
    radius `= 0`). The intersection can be perfectly TRANSVERSAL through it (the pair sine need
    NOT collapse), yet S3 breaks: `advanceParams` solves each surface's single-surface 2×2
    normal equations, and the vanishing `dU` row makes that 2×2 rank-1, so the `(u,v)` update
    is ill-conditioned even though the 3D residual + normal are fine (and the pole sits on a
    non-periodic `v` edge → spurious `BoundaryExit` / apex step-crawl). Additive to
    `marching.cpp` + new OCCT-free `chart_singularity.h`, gated `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI`, default-
    **off** `enableChartSingularities`; no `cc_*`. **(1) single-surface chart witness** —
    `chartConditionAt` finite-differences each surface's `‖dU‖` vs `‖dV‖·scale`; a collapse
    with a finite normal flags a pole/apex on THAT surface — computed from ONE surface's own
    Jacobian, DISTINCT from the S4-c pair sine and the S4-d locus-tangent flip, and a finite
    cap keeps a genuine domain boundary from being mistaken for a pole. **(2) point-based
    fixed-plane-cut crossing** — at a collapse, `crossChartSingularity` makes bounded fine
    POINT-BASED jumps along the fixed last-good tangent `t★` (the branch_point.h / S4-c cut),
    which never touches the degenerate `dU`, so it stays well-posed where `advanceParams`
    failed. **(3) loose chart map-back** — the sphere pole continues on the opposite meridian
    (`u_out = u_in + π mod 2π`), the cone apex is a single 3D point the curve passes through to
    the far nappe (`v → −v`); the singular point itself is never emitted. **(4) honest guard**
    — a node is emitted ONLY if it verifies on BOTH surfaces ≤ `onSurfTol` with real along-`t★`
    progress; on ANY failure the band is DISCARDED (roll back) and the march STOPS + defers →
    OCCT as a `NearTangent` gap (`nearTangentGaps`). No pole/apex point is ever fabricated.
    Both gates green: host `test_native_ssi_s4e_singularities` (**5 cases, 0 failed**; NUMSCI
    OFF CTest **26/26** with the S4-e suite correctly ABSENT, NUMSCI ON CTest **32/32**) + sim
    native-vs-OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS` parity (`scripts/run-sim-native-ssi-marching.sh`,

    (S3 truncated at half loop `len ≈ 3.1415`) is **FULLY traced** — `sphere-pole s4e singX=2
    NTgaps=0 closed=1`, `len` native 6.2829 vs OCCT 6.2832 (rel Δ 5.0e-05), nodes on the OCCT
    locus + both surfaces ≤ 1.51e-07; the double-cone `∩` plane line through the **apex** (S3
    step-collapsed at `v ≈ −0.04`) is **FULLY traced across both nappes** — `cone-apex s4e
    singX=1 NTgaps=0 nodes=159`, `v ∈ [−2.00, +2.00]`, on-locus 7.11e-16 / on-surface 6.79e-16.
    A genuine finite cylinder `v`-cap still exits as a `BoundaryExit` (chart machinery does NOT
    misfire). No regressions: the 5 transversal pairs stay `nt = 0` bit-identical, the S4-c
    graze still `crossed = 22`, the S4-d Steinmetz still `branchPts = 2 traced = 4`, S5
    `native-pass = 6` persists, tessellator byte-identical. Files:

    **SECOND SLICE — FREEFORM parametric pole (DONE at the bar):** the same point-based corrector
    is extended to a NURBS unit sphere — a genuine freeform pole (a `uPeriod == 0`
    collapsed-control-ROW surface of revolution, so NO analytic `u + π` meridian map; the
    degenerate normal `normalize(Sᵤ×Sᵥ)` is a finite near-zero `Dir3`, never NaN). The ONLY new
    code is the far-side re-seed: `chartsing::freeformChartInvert` recovers the far LONGITUDE by a
    POINT-ONLY 1-D search (the `u` at the fixed near-pole latitude minimizing `‖S.point(u,vFix) −
    target‖`, using `S.point` alone — no `dU`, no normal), and `chartFarUV` branches on `uPeriod`
    (the analytic `uPeriod > 0` path stays byte-identical). A NURBS-sphere ∩ plane that S3
    truncated at the first pole (half circle, `len ≈ 3.1415`) now crosses BOTH freeform poles and
    closes the full great circle: host `s4e_freeform_nurbs_pole_full_great_circle` LANDS

    genuine surface ENDPOINT, no far side) correctly still DEFERS — control
    `s4e_freeform_tip_endpoint_still_defers` asserts `singularitiesCrossed == 0`, `NearTangent`
    (honest truncation → OCCT), no point fabricated past the tip. **CURVE CUSP — honest DECLINE
    (no dead code):** a cusp (marcher velocity `‖n_A × n_B‖ → 0`) is IDENTICALLY the S4-c/S4-d
    pair-tangency witness, not the single-surface chart witness; by the IFT a cusp with regular
    charts + healthy pair sine is the empty set, so a standalone S4-e cusp witness would be
    unreachable dead code — none added; cusps route to S4-c/S4-d/OCCT, never faked. **Honest tail
    (DEFERRED → OCCT, measured gap, never faked):** **asymmetric** freeform poles whose
    continued-tangent re-seed does not verify on both surfaces, **higher-order / edge / seam**
    degeneracies, a full B-rep degenerate-pole B-spline SOLID through the boolean pipeline (no
    native construct yet feeds a freeform-pole face to the marcher — the fixtures are hand-seeded,
    like the analytic S4-e ones), and **S4-f self-intersection completeness**. Files unchanged from

  - **SSI Stage S5-d (BRANCHED-TRACE CURVED BOOLEAN — Steinmetz COMMON) — DONE at the
    verification bar (both gates); the FUSE/CUT completion follows immediately below.** The S4-d
    branched trace is now turned into a native BOOLEAN: the Steinmetz bicylinder COMMON. On the S4 decline edge (`nearTangentGaps > 0`,
    no usable single seam) a cheap `steinmetzPreGate` (both `Cylinder`, `|rA−rB| ≤ tol`, axes
    orthogonal + crossing) RE-TRACES with `MarchOptions.enableBranchPoints = true`;
    `recogniseSteinmetzTrace` accepts the branched `TraceSet` ONLY when canonical
    (`nearTangentGaps == 0`, `branchPoints == 2`, exactly four `BranchArc` arms, each arm's
    endpoints coincident with the two branch-node points) — anything else → NULL → OCCT.
    `buildSteinmetzCommon` splits each cylinder wall along its two arcs into the inside-the-other
    lune patches (planar-triangle strips walked branch-to-branch in lockstep, every interior
    sample on the analytic cylinder), keeps the four whose centroid is inside the other cylinder,
    and welds them into ONE watertight shell through a single `VertexPool` — both sides of every
    arc and all four arcs at each branch point draw the SAME pooled nodes (the two branch-point
    vertices pooled once), seam-adjacent facets are planar triangles (S5-a discipline, no
    analytic face on a shared seam). The engine's existing `16 R³/3` oracle self-verifies and
    owns the OCCT fallback. **At the bar:** COMMON of two equal-R=1 orthogonal cylinders is
    non-NULL, watertight, enclosed volume 5.3287 vs the EXACT analytic `16/3 = 5.33333` **and**

    + A's caps + B's lune patches emitted REVERSED (inward normal, bounding the carved channel,

- â **`#4b` Tier E â native `cc_wrap_emboss` â DEFERRED (FUTURE WORK, not scheduled
  yet).** This is the *native* (OCCT-free) rewrite of wrap-emboss; it is distinct from
  the Phase-3 `add-robust-wrap-emboss` change, which is â done and OCCT-backed (the
  app-facing behaviour already works). UPDATE 2026-07-05: the FIRST NATIVE SLICE has
  since LANDED -- emboss a RECTANGULAR pad onto a CYLINDER lateral face is now native +
  verified vs OCCT (see the `#7 native-wrap-emboss` entry below; `add-native-wrap-emboss`
  archived `2026-07-05`). UPDATE 2026-07-07: the BREADTH change `add-native-wrap-emboss-breadth`
  (archived `2026-07-07`) widened the native path with T1 DEBOSS (recessed rectangular
  pocket on a cylinder, `boss=0`) and T2 NON-RECTANGULAR polygon emboss AND deboss on a
  cylinder. Residual that STILL stays OCCT-fallthrough: non-cylindrical (cone / sphere /
  freeform) bases (T3 honest decline — no native builder, since the OCCT oracle is itself
  cylinder-only), self-intersecting / dense / high-curvature profiles, `>2pi` / off-end
  footprints, and `depth >= R` debosses. The plan below is retained for those remaining
  general slices. Native wrap-emboss needs three pieces:
  (1) native project-a-2D-pattern-onto-a-surface into the target face UV domain,
  (2) native offset-along-normal by the emboss depth, and (3) a boolean merge of the
  raised/recessed region with the base solid. Step (2) is now **unblocked by #6** â the
  native planar `cc_offset_face` (slide a planar face along its normal + drag the side
  faces, EXACT slab, self-verified vs OCCT) is exactly the planar offset-along-normal a
  PLANAR-face emboss/deboss needs; step (3) is **partially unblocked by #5** (a
  planar-polyhedron emboss/deboss can use the native BSP-CSG fuse/cut, and â with the
  curved analytic slice now archived â an AXIS-ALIGNED-CYLINDER target can use the native
  box-cylinder curved fuse/cut). So a **planar-target wrap-emboss is now reachable
  natively** (native offset from #6 + native planar boolean from #5), the **boolean step
  of an axis-aligned-cylinder-target wrap-emboss is now also native** (curved analytic
  slice of #5), and only a **general curved-surface** wrap-emboss still waits on the
  **general curved native-boolean slice of #5** plus a **curved-surface native offset** (the
  planar slice of #6 does not offset curved faces). Native wrap-emboss remains sequenced
  AFTER #6, as its own OpenSpec change (`/opsx:propose`) â the planar slice can be
  proposed now that #6 landed; the curved slice waits on curved #5 + curved offset. Until
  then `cc_wrap_emboss` stays OCCT-fallthrough (labelled, verified). Robust-watertight
  `cc_helical_thread`/`cc_tapered_thread` are **NO LONGER deferred** â the mesher
  shared-edge weld (edge_mesher `CanonicalEndpoints` / face_mesher `BoundaryAnchors`) is
  DONE, so a well-formed helical / tapered thread now meshes `boundaryEdges==0` at EVERY
  deflection in the `robustlyWatertight` ladder and runs NATIVE (see the Tier D entry
  above; `test_native_thread` asserts the hard multi-deflection watertight ladder and
  `test_native_engine::native_thread_runs_native_watertight` asserts the op runs native
  through the facade). Several other residual #4b natives are now DONE by the
  geometry-completion batch above â **kind-3 SPLINE profile edge extrude, off-axis-arc TORUS
  revolve, N-section (3+) ruled loft, and a NON-PLANAR (RMF) sweep are now NATIVE.** What is
  still OCCT-fallthrough are the cases that genuinely need SSI / Tier-4 (surface-surface
  intersection + trimming): the accumulating-twist/scale `cc_twisted_sweep`, the guided/rail
  cases (`cc_guided_sweep` / `cc_loft_along_rail` / hard-rail loft), a mismatched-count /
  non-planar loft, a truly self-intersecting sweep or thread, a general SPLINE
  surface-of-revolution, and a spindle torus.

  + weld), so it meshes by the SAME path a native prism / boolean does; the engine

  **CONVEX (cyl <-> coaxial cap rim, REMOVES material):** a ball of radius `r` rolled into

  to both: its centre traces a circle of radius `Rc - r` at height `H - r` -- the
  tube-centre circle of a TORUS coaxial with the cylinder (major `R = Rc - r`, minor
  `r`). The blend surface is that torus's quarter-tube `v in [0, pi/2]`: at `v = 0` the
  point is at radius `Rc` with a RADIAL normal (tangent circle on the cylinder wall --
  `torus n cylinder`, an analytic SSI-S1 coaxial seam); at `v = pi/2` the point is at

  perpendicular to the axis), resolves the cap + far-end axial heights, and rebuilds the
  whole filleted solid as one deflection-bounded planar-facet soup -- far cap, cylinder
  wall up to the wall seam, the torus quarter-tube (each curved quad SPLIT INTO TWO
  TRIANGLES so every facet is exactly planar and welds watertight), and the trimmed cap --
  all four parts sharing the SAME `N` angular samples so the wall->torus (`H-r`, `Rc`) and
  torus->cap (`H`, `Rc-r`) seams weld with coincident vertices. Requires a RING torus
  `Rc >= 2r` (else the tube self-intersects the axis -> NULL -> OCCT). Dispatched in
  `NativeEngine::fillet_edges` AFTER the planar path declines, then the MANDATORY
  `blendResultVerified` self-verify (watertight + `0 < Vr < Vo`) accepts it or discards ->
  OCCT. Gate 1 GREEN -- host `test_native_blend` adds the closed-form-volume assertion +
  `curved_fillet_g1_tangent_at_both_seams` (a pure-math check that the torus canal normal
  is exactly radial at `v=0` vs the cylinder normal and exactly axial at `v=pi/2` vs the
  cap normal, and the seam radii coincide -- ANALYTIC, no mesh, no OCCT). Gate 2 GREEN --
  `run-sim-native-curved-fillet.sh` **9/9** through the `cc_*` facade under
  `cc_set_engine(1)` (`activeNative=1`), native torus blend vs OCCT `BRepFilletAPI`:
  vol rel <= 3.8e-3, area rel <= 2.1e-3, watertight, mesh-vol == B-rep, across
  `Rc in {5,4,6}` incl. the `Rc=2r` ring-torus boundary; the reported `cos(wall seam)=1.0
  / cos(cap seam)=1.0` is the ANALYTIC G1 the construction guarantees (flagged
  analytic-not-mesh-sampled, honestly). **CONCAVE (boss cylinder <-> larger coaxial plane
  base rim, ADDS material):** the everyday inside fillet -- a boss standing on a larger
  slab, filleting the base rim (a CONCAVE dihedral). The ball seats on the MATERIAL side, so
  the ball-centre offset sign FLIPS: the torus tube-centre circle has major `R = Rc + r`
  (convex was `Rc - r`) at height `H + r`, still a coaxial TORUS quarter-tube, tangent to the
  wall at the `v=0` circle of radius `Rc` and to the plane at the `v=pi/2` circle of radius
  `Rc + r` (the plane is rebuilt as an ANNULUS with inner radius `Rc + r`). Because it fills
  the reflex corner, the fillet ADDS material and the enclosed volume GROWS. Built in the same
  OCCT-free `curved_fillet.h` as `concave_fillet_edge(...)` (additive-only; the convex
  `curved_fillet_edge` is byte-identical), reusing the same trim + weld helpers. Dispatched in
  `NativeEngine::fillet_edges` as the THIRD candidate (planar SHRINK -> convex-curved SHRINK ->
  concave-curved GROW), each gated by its OWN correctly-signed `blendResultVerified`: the
  concave path uses `wantGrow=true` (watertight + `Vr > Vo`, the SAME grow branch offset-face
  uses) -- no new guard, no weakened tolerance; a convex candidate can never pass grow and a
  concave never passes shrink, so the sign cannot be spoofed. Gate 1 GREEN -- host
  `test_native_blend` adds `concave_fillet_boss_on_plate_watertight_volume_grown`,
  `concave_fillet_g1_tangent_at_both_seams` (analytic, seams `Rc` / `Rc+r`), and

  asserted only against 6e-2): the upright-meridian canal differs from OCCT's tilted evolved envelope
  by O(r') in the INTERIOR, agreeing exactly at both seams and in the `r1=r2` limit -- REPORTED
  honestly, never hidden behind the HARD bound. STILL OCCT-fallthrough (NULL / self-verify discards,

  cylinder<->coaxial-planar-cap rim chamfered as a CONE FRUSTUM (straight bevel, C0 NOT G1),
  verified vs OCCT `BRepFilletAPI_MakeChamfer`.** Unlike the #6 fillet (a curved TORUS arc, G1-tangent),
  a chamfer cuts a FLAT bevel: for a circular rim it is a CONE-FRUSTUM band between the two SETBACK
  circles -- one on the cylinder wall at axial setback `= d`, one on the cap at radial setback `= d` --
  meeting each face at the chamfer angle (**C0, NOT G1**; asserting tangency would be geometrically
  WRONG for a chamfer). Built OCCT-FREE in a NEW header `src/native/blend/curved_chamfer.h` as
  `curved_chamfer_edge(...)` (additive-only; it `#include`s `curved_fillet.h` to REUSE the rim
  recognition (`detail::facesOnRim`, `cylinderInfo`, `rimGeom`), the `sagittaSteps` angular tiling, and
  the `emit*`/planar-facet weld helpers). It rebuilds the capped-cylinder region as one

  closed-form CIRCLES (cylinder seam radius `Rc`; cap seam radius `Rc-d`) -- no solver, no NUMSCI.
  `native_blend.h` gains the new `#include`. Wired into `NativeEngine::chamfer_edges` as a THREE-way

  slices use the SHRINK branch. The planar builder is tried FIRST and is byte-identical (a circular rim
  declines it), so the planar chamfer path does not regress. Gate 1 GREEN -- host `test_native_blend`

- **#7 `native-wrap-emboss` -- NATIVE now covers EMBOSS + DEBOSS + NON-RECTANGULAR POLYGON
  on a CYLINDER, verified vs OCCT `cc_wrap_emboss`.** The control (raised RECTANGULAR pad
  on a cylinder) is unchanged; the breadth change `add-native-wrap-emboss-breadth` (archived
  `2026-07-07`) added T1 DEBOSS (recessed rectangular pocket, `boss=0`, volume SHRINKS by
  `footprint area * depth`, boolean-cut mirror of the pad with an inward `R-depth` floor and
  pocket-facing wall normals; guard `depth >= R` -> NULL) and T2 NON-RECTANGULAR: an N-vertex
  (`count>=3`) closed SIMPLE polygon footprint (ear-clipped cap, one ruled side wall per edge,
  bbox-minus-polygon base wall) embossed OR debossed (T1xT2 crossed deboss-polygon also native).
  Self-intersecting / degenerate polygons -> NULL -> OCCT. T3 FREEFORM base (cone / sphere) is an
  HONEST DECLINE — NO native cone/sphere builder exists because the OCCT `cc_wrap_emboss` oracle
  is itself CYLINDER-ONLY (rejects Sphere/Cone faces), so there is no parity oracle to certify
  against; `cylinderWall` returns NULL for any non-cylinder face (no dead never-accepted path).
  Sim `run-sim-native-wrap-emboss.sh` **14/14** (6/6 rect-control byte-stable + deboss-rect x2 +
  emboss/deboss-hex), vol rel <= 8e-3, area rel <= 1.6e-2, all watertight, mesh-vol == B-rep.
  Host `test_native_wrap_emboss` 7/7. FIRST-SLICE detail (unchanged control) follows. The Phase-3
  `cc_wrap_emboss` (#290) stays the ORACLE; this adds a NATIVE path behind the same ABI.
  Built OCCT-FREE in `src/native/feature/wrap_emboss.h`: for `boss=1` (emboss) on a native
  solid whose picked face is a Cylinder wall, it wraps a closed 4-corner rectangular
  footprint by the SAME map the OCCT oracle uses (`u = px/R` arc-length->angle,
  `v = py + vMid` axial, `vMid` = wall's axial middle), then rebuilds the whole embossed
  solid as one deflection-bounded planar-facet soup -- the pad's OUTER CAP (cylinder patch
  at `R+height` over the footprint window), two CIRCUMFERENTIAL walls (planes perp to axis
  at `v=vMin,vMax`), two AXIAL walls (planes through the axis at `u=uMin,uMax`), and the
  base cylinder wall retiled over the FULL turn with the footprint window REMOVED -- every
  part sharing a common `u`-sample sequence (window arc = the first `nUwin` cells) so all
  seams weld watertight via the boolean `assembleSolid` (each curved quad SPLIT INTO TWO
  TRIANGLES, planar-facet discipline). Why a facet soup, not an SSI fuse: the pad carries
  planar walls + a cylindrical cap, so it is NOT a single elementary curved solid and the
  S5-a single-elementary-pair `ssi_boolean_solid` cannot drive it -- mirroring the curved-
  fillet slice is the robust path. Dispatched in `NativeEngine::wrap_emboss` for a native
  body (an OCCT body forwards to the Phase-3 oracle unconditionally), then the MANDATORY
  `wrapEmbossVerified` self-verify (watertight + volume GROWS by ~ `footprint area *
  height`; the wrapped footprint area equals the flat profile area because `px` is already
  arc-length) accepts it or discards -> OCCT; a native body the slice declines returns an
  HONEST ERROR (never forwarded -- OCCT would misread the native void). Gate 1 GREEN --
  host `test_native_wrap_emboss` (footprint/rectangle recovery + facet-soup watertightness
  + volume-growth + decline of deboss/non-rectangular/non-cylindrical). Gate 2 GREEN --
  `run-sim-native-wrap-emboss.sh` **6/6** through the `cc_*` facade under

  `Rc in {10,8,12}`. Native-vs-OCCT gap is deflection-bounded (planar-facet tiling vs
  OCCT's exact cylindrical faces), well inside the 1% bar; nothing faked. STILL OCCT
  (NULL / honest error), AFTER the breadth change: NON-cylindrical (cone / sphere / planar /
  NURBS) base (T3 honest decline — no native builder; OCCT oracle is cylinder-only),

  (engine-wired behind the same `cc_set_engine(1)` toggle) for a native-built solid
  whose every face surface + edge curve is in the writer's scope: it walks the
  native B-rep (src/native/topology) and emits a valid ISO-10303-21 STEP AP203 file

  aggregate `native_exchange.h`, entry `step_export_native(solid, path)`) on the
  #1â#6 topology/math foundation. The native builders emit PER-FACE edges (edge-node
  sharing deferred, NATIVE-REWRITE.md #4), so the writer DEDUPLICATES geometrically â
  coincident vertices collapse to one VERTEX_POINT and the two faces meeting at a
  physical edge share ONE EDGE_CURVE (used forward on one face, reversed on the
  other via ORIENTED_EDGE) â producing a properly-sewn manifold CLOSED_SHELL that
  re-reads as a solid, not a heap of coincident faces. **Native-else-OCCT wiring
  (honest):** `NativeEngine::step_export` runs native for a native body IN SCOPE;
  a native body OUT of scope (an unsupported geometry kind) returns a clean error
  (never a native void handed to OCCT); a NON-native (OCCT-built) body forwards to
  `STEPControl_Writer`. **`cc_step_import` STAYS OCCT at export time** (parsing arbitrary STEP is
  the huge part; a first native IMPORT slice landed later â see the import bullet below) and **`cc_iges_export/import` STAY OCCT** â that is
  the honest end state (#8 drop-occt stays blocked on import + IGES + curved/general
  booleans). No cc_* ABI change; default engine stays OCCT. Entity arg orders were
  cross-checked against the OCCT `RWStep*` writer modules (EDGE_CURVE / ADVANCED_FACE

  6 faces / 24 edges; cylinder vol rel 1.27e-3, 9 faces; holed-plate vol rel 2.90e-4,
  7 faces, valid), the native-written and OCCT-written files re-read to EQUIVALENT
  solids (writer-parity rel â¤ 4.7e-15), and a FOREIGN (OCCT-built) body forwards to
  `STEPControl_Writer` (fall-through, active native). **Two writer bugs fixed to reach
  this gate:** (1) EDGE_LOOP / ADVANCED_FACE emitted a stray extra empty string
  (`'',''`), giving EDGE_LOOP 3 args (schema 2) and ADVANCED_FACE 5 (schema 4) â OCCT
  rejected both and transferred an EMPTY solid (0 faces, vol 0); (2) a full-turn
  periodic wall (a cylindrical hole wall) was emitted as a periodic surface trimmed to
  its full period with NO seam edge, which OCCT reads back with zero wall area (a
  leaky, invalid solid) â the writer now synthesises the required SEAM edge (a straight
  LINE used forward at u=period and reversed at u=0, mirroring `STEPControl_Writer`'s
  cylindrical-hole-wall representation) for any Cylinder/Cone/Sphere face whose loop is
  closed full-circle rim edges. Both are pinned by host regression tests
  (`edge_loop_and_advanced_face_have_schema_arg_counts`,
  `cylindrical_hole_wall_emits_seam_edge`). The sewn re-read solid legitimately gains
  one seam edge per periodic wall the native deferred-edge-sharing source omits
  (native src 28 â re-read 30 for the holed plate, matching OCCT's own writer), which
  the harness edge-count check now accepts as a bounded superset. STILL OCCT at export time (never
  faked): STEP IMPORT (a native subset landed later, below), IGES import/export, and a
  native solid with an out-of-scope geometry kind (Ellipse/Bezier curve, rational
  spline, Bezier surface) â OCCT fallback for an OCCT body / honest error for a
  native void. Living change `add-native-data-exchange` **archived** (validate

- ✅ **#7/#3 `native-exchange` — FIRST native STEP IMPORT slice DONE at BOTH gates (host round-trip + sim OCCT parity); sits on the #4 healing slice.** Behind the existing `cc_step_import(path)` ABI (default engine still OCCT), `NativeEngine::step_import` now runs an OCCT-FREE ISO-10303-21 (Part 21) reader (`src/native/exchange/step_reader.{h,cpp}`, entry `step_import_native(path)` / `readStepString`) that tokenizes the DATA section into a `map<int,Record>` (integer refs `#N`, typed reals incl. `1.E2`, strings, enums `.T.`, nested lists, `$`) and runs a TWO-PASS mapper: leaf geometry (CARTESIAN_POINT / DIRECTION / AXIS2_PLACEMENT_3D, LINE / CIRCLE / B_SPLINE_CURVE_WITH_KNOTS, PLANE / CYLINDRICAL_SURFACE / CONICAL_SURFACE / SPHERICAL_SURFACE / B_SPLINE_SURFACE) then topology (VERTEX_POINT → EDGE_CURVE → ORIENTED_EDGE → EDGE_LOOP → FACE_OUTER_BOUND/FACE_BOUND → ADVANCED_FACE → CLOSED_SHELL → MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP), deduping shared EDGE_CURVE/VERTEX_POINT, building the B-rep through `topology::ShapeBuilder`, then running `heal::healShell` to close the sub-tolerance gaps STEP carries. It is the EXACT inverse of `step_writer.cpp` (writer untouched — additive). **Honest decline → OCCT (never fabricated):** unsupported surface/curve keyword (TOROIDAL / SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION / offset / trimmed / Bezier surface; ELLIPSE / TRIMMED_CURVE / Bezier / rational-weighted B-spline), assembly / >1 MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP, non-mm unit, malformed/dangling record, or any reconstruction failing the watertight+vol>0 self-verify → NULL, and the engine falls through to `STEPControl_Reader` (labelled). **Gate 1 (host, NO OCCT) GREEN** — `test_native_step_reader` 9/9: box round-trips EXACT (vol 1000, 6 faces / 8 verts / 12 edges, watertight), cylinder + holed-plate watertight with vol rel<1e-9 (host round-trip is byte-inverse of the writer, un-foolably native since no OCCT is linked), and 5 decline cases (TOROIDAL surface, 2-root assembly, non-mm unit, malformed string, empty) return NULL. Host CTest **29/29**. **Gate 2 (sim vs OCCT `STEPControl_Reader`) GREEN** — `tests/sim/native_step_import_parity.mm` + `scripts/run-sim-native-step-import.sh`: **`[NIMPORT]` 15 passed / 0 failed** — native-written box (vol rel 2.27e-16), cylinder (rel 1.27e-3), holed-plate (rel 2.90e-4) all watertight and matching the OCCT re-import within tol, AND FOREIGN OCCT-`STEPControl_Writer`-written box + cylinder imported NATIVELY match OCCT re-import EXACTLY (rel 0). The native path is provably exercised on gate 2(a): the reader reports per-face-oriented edge counts (box 24=2×12, cyl 30) whereas an OCCT fallback would report OCCT's unique count. **Honest residual / deferred to OCCT:** assemblies, AP242, complex/typed profiles beyond the writer's set, all IGES, and a B-spline-FACE solid round-trip (the reader maps B_SPLINE_SURFACE but no `cc_solid_*` builder emits a watertight bspline-face fixture, so no non-fabricated fixture exists yet — documented gap, not silently skipped). Change `add-native-step-import` archived (validate --strict green).
- ✅ **#7 `native-exchange` — STEP IMPORT WIDENED: multi-solid Compound + B-spline-face round-trip landed; ELLIPSE curve recognised; torus stays OCCT.** Building on the first import slice, three independent honestly-gated breadth tracks (change `widen-native-step-import`, archived `2026-07-06`, validate --strict green; host CTest **29/29**, sim **`[NIMPORT]` 28/28**). **LANDED (genuine native, verified vs OCCT):** (T2) **multi-solid** — a flat file with >1 root `MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP` (no assembly transform tree) now imports as a native `topology::Compound` of watertight Solids instead of a blanket decline (`findManifoldBreps` collects all roots, `build()` maps each and `ShapeBuilder::makeCompound`s them; one root still returns a bare Solid — byte-identical prior behaviour); engine self-verify requires EVERY member watertight (`robustlyWatertightMulti`); sim vs OCCT re-import `nativeVol=1064 occtVol=1064 rel=2.14e-16`, per-solid watertight + count/bbox match. (T3) **B-spline-FACE round-trip** closed (prior deferred task 7.4) — the EXISTING native `build_prism_profile_spline` op (NOT a fabricated fixture) emits a watertight `B_SPLINE_SURFACE`-face solid that round-trips native-export→native-import EXACT (`vol nat=304.38 orig=304.38`, watertight, face-count + `B_SPLINE_SURFACE` present). **PARTIAL:** (T1a) the reader now RECOGNISES + maps the `ELLIPSE('',#pos,a,b)` curve entity to the genuine `EdgeCurve::Kind::Ellipse` (major=a along frame X, minor=b along Y; degenerate → decline), verified by a host edge-mapping test — **but there is NO watertight NATIVE ellipse-bearing-solid import**: a foreign OCCT-authored ellipse-cut solid parses yet its ellipse-on-quadric pcurve is out of this slice, fails the watertight self-verify (`watertight=0 nativeVol=0`), and the whole solid FALLS BACK to OCCT (`ellipse_cut vol nat=942.478 oracle=942.478` = the OCCT fallback). **NOT LANDED (documented DECLINE → OCCT):** (T1b) `TOROIDAL_SURFACE` — no native `FaceSurface::Kind::Torus` and the tessellator must not be modified, so the reader returns NULL and the engine falls back (`torus native parsed=0`, `fallback torus rel=0.00e+00`). A `hasNestedAssembly()` guard also DECLINEs any transform tree (`NEXT_ASSEMBLY_USAGE_OCCURRENCE` / `MAPPED_ITEM` / `REPRESENTATION_RELATIONSHIP*` / `ITEM_DEFINED_TRANSFORMATION` / `CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION`) → OCCT. **Honest residual → OCCT (unchanged):** torus, ellipse-on-quadric solids, nested/transformed assemblies, `SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION`, `TRIMMED_CURVE`, rational/weighted B-splines, `BEZIER`, AP242 / PMI, non-mm units, all IGES. `step_writer.cpp`, the tessellator, and the `cc_*` ABI are PRISTINE. Does NOT unblock #8 `drop-occt` (a general STEP/AP242 reader + IGES + a general-curved kernel still block it).
- ✅ **#7 `native-exchange` — STEP IMPORT WIDENED to RIGID PLACED ASSEMBLIES + AP214/AP242 header acceptance pinned.** Building on the multi-solid slice, the reader now imports a single-level assembly with a transform tree as a native PLACED `topology::Compound` (change `add-native-step-assemblies`, archived `2026-07-06`, validate --strict green; host CTest **29/29** NUMSCI OFF, **36/36** NUMSCI ON; sim **`[NIMPORT]` 33/33**). **LANDED (genuine native, verified vs OCCT):** the `hasNestedAssembly()` decline is replaced by an `assembly()` builder that parses the OCCT-emitted transform structure — `CONTEXT_DEPENDENT_SHAPE_REPRESENTATION` → `REPRESENTATION_RELATIONSHIP_WITH_TRANSFORMATION` → `ITEM_DEFINED_TRANSFORMATION` (an `AXIS2_PLACEMENT_3D` from/to pair) — composes each component's RIGID placement `T = frameToWorld(to) ∘ frameToWorld(from)⁻¹`, gates it with `isRigid` (orthonormal `M·Mᵀ≈I` AND det≈+1, tol 1e-9), resolves each component representation's root `MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP`(s) STRUCTURALLY (by refs, not names), maps them via the UNCHANGED `mapManifoldBrep` in local coords, and pushes each `solid.located(Location{T})` into the Compound (native topology carries the placement on edges/faces — no geometry baked). Requires every root brep placed EXACTLY once (`placed.size()==findManifoldBreps().size()`) else NULL — never partial, never identity-defaulted. The flat multi-solid path and single-solid path are byte-for-byte unchanged; only a present transform tree takes the new branch. Sim vs OCCT `STEPControl_Reader` re-import on an OCCT-`STEPControl_Writer`-authored 2-box assembly (box B carries a non-baked `TopLoc_Location`: rotate 0.5 rad about Z + translate(30,5,0), so the writer emits the CDSR/REP_REL/ITEM_DEFINED chain rather than world-baked coords): **solids 2/2, nativeVol=1216 occtVol=1216 (mass rel 3.74e-16), bbox maxCornerΔ=0.00e+00 (tol 5e-3), topology faces 12/12**. **Schema-independence pinned:** the reader enters at `DATA;` and never gates on `FILE_SCHEMA`, so AP203/AP214/AP242 headers all import — confirmed live on a real OCCT-authored AP214 (`AUTOMOTIVE_DESIGN`) file (`header=AP214(1) native parsed=1 solids=1`). **Honest decline → OCCT (verified, never fabricated):** Form-B `MAPPED_ITEM`/`REPRESENTATION_MAP` (`decline_form_b_mapped_item_returns_null`); any non-rigid (scaled/mirrored/sheared) transform (the det≈+1 orthonormal gate); a transform tree with no composable placement (`placedCount==0`, e.g. lone NAUO — `decline_assembly_without_transform_returns_null`); a child rep resolving to 0 or >1 brep, a brep placed twice, or >1 unplaced root; out-of-slice component geometry (torus → `parsed=0` → OCCT). **Residual → OCCT (narrowed):** PMI/GD&T, non-rigid/scaled/mirrored transforms, deep-nested (multi-level) assemblies, complex/trimmed profiles, `SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION`, ellipse-on-quadric solids, `TOROIDAL_SURFACE`, rational/weighted B-splines, `BEZIER`, non-mm units, all IGES. Exactly 3 files changed (`step_reader.cpp`, `test_native_step_reader.cpp`, `native_step_import_parity.mm`); `step_writer.cpp`, tessellator, `src/engine/**`, and the `cc_*` ABI PRISTINE; `src/native/**` OCCT-free. Does NOT unblock #8 `drop-occt`.
- ✅ **#7 `native-exchange` — STEP IMPORT WIDENED to UNIFORM-SCALE + MIRROR placed assemblies (T1) + AP242 geometry with PMI SKIPPED (T2).** Building on the rigid-assembly slice, the reader now composes two more affine placement classes and tolerates AP242 annotation graphs (change `add-native-step-scaled-ap242`, archived `2026-07-06`, validate --strict green; host CTest **29/29** NUMSCI OFF / **36/36** NUMSCI ON, `test_native_step_reader` **20 cases**; sim **`[NIMPORT]` 41/41**). **LANDED (T1, genuine native):** the boolean `isRigid` gate is replaced by `classifyPlacement(const math::Transform&)` — a Gram-matrix conformality test `MᵀM ≈ k²·I` with a det-sign branch → `Rigid`(k≈1,det>0) | `UniformScale`(k>0,det>0) | `Mirror`(det<0), and `nullopt` (DECLINE) for a non-conformal `MᵀM` (non-uniform/shear). `Rigid` reproduces the old path byte-for-byte. A **UniformScale** component (parsed from a `CARTESIAN_TRANSFORMATION_OPERATOR_3D` scale, or a frame-encoded `k·I`; a `_NON_UNIFORM` / unequal `scale1/2/3` form declines) rides `solid.located(Location{T})` directly and self-verifies with volume `k³·V₀` — k=2 → total vol 2728 = 1000 + 216·8, component bbox [30,5,0]..[42,17,12], watertight. A **Mirror** component is orientation-complemented with the EXISTING `topo::Orientation` `reversed`/`complemented` algebra BEFORE the mirror `Location`, so the tessellator's tangent-derived normal (`cross(place(∂u),place(∂v))`, which flips under det<0) points OUTWARD again — the mirrored solid self-verifies watertight with POSITIVE volume 1216 (not −216) and reflected bbox z∈[−6,0]. **No tessellator change, no new topology primitive.** **Honest caveat (load-bearing):** OCCT's `STEPControl_Writer` **cannot serialize** a scaled/mirror assembly location — a 2× component re-imports at native size (scale silently dropped; the IDT AXIS2 frames stay orthonormal), a `SetMirror` becomes a proper 180° rotation (det +1), and the trimmed iOS OCCT throws "Location with scaling transformation is forbidden" on a scaled `TopLoc_Datum3D`; a `CARTESIAN_TRANSFORMATION_OPERATOR_3D` in the IDT slot is schema-invalid and OCCT's reader ignores it. So there is **no OCCT oracle for genuine k³/reflection** — T1 is verified against an **analytic** expectation via the standard STEP scale/mirror operator, and separately verified native == OCCT on the OCCT-authored fixtures that degrade to rigid. **LANDED (T2, genuine native):** the two GLOBAL record scans are relaxed so an AP242 file is not declined for carrying PMI. `validateUnitContext()` now answers exactly "is the LENGTH unit millimetre?" — a length `SI_UNIT` MUST be `.MILLI.` (mm gate UNCHANGED, no tolerance weakened) while a non-length `SI_UNIT` (`.RADIAN.`/`.STERADIAN.`, PMI angle/plane-angle contexts) is SKIPPED, not read as non-mm. `hasNestedAssembly()`/`assemblyDisposition()` return the assembly path only for a transform relationship that reaches a `MANIFOLD_SOLID_BREP`; a `REPRESENTATION_RELATIONSHIP`/`MAPPED_ITEM`/`CDSR` in the annotation/draughting graph that reaches no geometric root brep is SKIPPED, and the completeness gate is computed over the GEOMETRIC root breps only. An AP242 file (rewritten schema + injected PMI/GD&T/draughting incl. a rep-rel graph) imports the SOLID identically to the OCCT re-import (vol 1000, bbox Δ=0, faces 6/6) with PMI skipped — the previously-fatal rep-rel-PMI case now imports instead of declining. **Honest decline → OCCT (verified, never fabricated):** non-uniform-scale / shear transforms (`decline_non_uniform_shear_assembly_returns_null`, sim `shear` → NULL); a mirrored member that still fails the watertight self-verify after compensation; PMI/GD&T **semantics** (never turned into geometry); Form-B `MAPPED_ITEM`/`REPRESENTATION_MAP`; lone NAUO with no composable placement; deep-nested (multi-level) assemblies; out-of-slice component geometry (`TOROIDAL_SURFACE` etc.); ellipse-on-quadric solids; complex/trimmed profiles; rational/weighted B-splines; non-mm units; all IGES. Exactly 2 native/exchange files changed (`step_reader.{cpp,h}`) + 2 tests; `step_writer.cpp`, tessellator, `src/engine/**`, and the `cc_*` ABI PRISTINE; `src/native/**` OCCT-free. Does NOT unblock #8 `drop-occt`.
- ✅ **#7 `native-exchange` — STEP IMPORT WIDENED to TRIMMED_CURVE edges (T1) + a cylinder-reducing SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION (T2).** Building on the scaled/AP242 slice, the reader accepts two leaf-geometry families it previously declined outright (change `add-native-step-general-surfaces`, archived `2026-07-06`, validate --strict green; host CTest **29/29** NUMSCI OFF / **36/36** NUMSCI ON, `test_native_step_reader` **26 cases**; sim **`[NIMPORT]` 53/53**). **LANDED (T1, genuine native):** `curve()` now ACCEPTS `TRIMMED_CURVE('',#basis,trim_1,trim_2,sense,master)` — `trimmedCurve()` unwraps the basis (`LINE`/`CIRCLE`/`ELLIPSE`/`B_SPLINE_CURVE_WITH_KNOTS`, incl. through the SURFACE_CURVE wrapper) onto the native `EdgeCurve`. For a **B-spline** basis the two cached `PARAMETER_VALUE` trims drive `[first,last]` (the covered knot sub-domain, clamped to the clamped span — info the endpoint vertices cannot recover); for an **analytic** basis the exact vertex-derived range is kept (trims redundant). `sense_agreement`/`master_representation` are not consulted. A foreign OCCT-authored solid whose edge geometry is wrapped in a TRIMMED_CURVE imports NATIVELY watertight == OCCT re-import (vol rel 1.27e-3, bboxΔ=0, faces 9/9). **LANDED (T2, cylinder case ONLY):** `surface()` accepts `SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION('',#profile,#axis1)` (via `axis1placement` + `surfaceOfRevolution` + `revolvedLine`) ONLY when the profile is a straight `LINE` **parallel** to the axis → an EXACT native `Cylinder` (radius = ⊥-distance from line to axis); verified native == OCCT re-import (watertight, vol rel 1.27e-3). **HONEST DECLINE → OCCT (NOT implemented — the code has NO `reduceToQuadric` and NO `revolveToRationalBSpline`):** a SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION of an **oblique** line (a cone — the reader's apex-carrying cone does not round-trip watertight, a separate pre-existing gap), a **perpendicular** line (a planar annulus), or **any non-line** profile (a circle/arc → sphere/torus, an ellipse/B-spline → general revolved surface) returns `nullopt` → OCCT, kept consistent with the landed `TOROIDAL_SURFACE` decline — host `surface_of_revolution_oblique_line_declines` + `surface_of_revolution_circle_generatrix_declines`, sim `revolution decline parsed=0` with the OCCT fallback matching `cc_set_engine(0)` (torus vol 523.599 rel 0). Exactly 3 files changed (`step_reader.cpp`, `test_native_step_reader.cpp`, `native_step_import_parity.mm`); `step_writer.cpp`, tessellator, `src/engine/**`, and the `cc_*` ABI PRISTINE; `src/native/**` OCCT-free. Does NOT unblock #8 `drop-occt`.
- ✅ **#7 `native-exchange` — SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION analytic-quadric reductions (cone / plane landed native; sphere reduction host-verified).** Extends the prior slice's cylinder-only revolution arm to classify the generatrix and emit the matching native `FaceSurface` kind (change `add-native-step-revolution-quadrics`, archived `2026-07-07`, validate --strict green; host CTest **29/29** NUMSCI OFF / **36/36** NUMSCI ON, `test_native_step_reader` **31 cases** incl. **8** revolution cases; sim **`[NIMPORT]` 65/65**). **LANDED — oblique `LINE` → native `Cone`:** `revolvedLine` dispatches by the line-axis angle `c=|Â·D̂|`; `lineMeetsAxis` computes the common perpendicular and the apex on the axis (skew → DECLINE, a hyperboloid), emitting `FaceSurface{Cone}` (origin on axis, `Z=+axis`, signed `semiAngle=acos(c)`) matching the direct `CONICAL_SURFACE` convention. This needed a genuine reader **bug fix** first — `pcurveFor`'s constant-`u` meridian took the angle from the endpoint AT the apex (`atan2(0,0)=0` collapsed every apex-touching wall onto `u=0`, tearing the cone into 97 open edges); `radialFromAxis` now takes the constant `u` from the endpoint FARTHER from the axis, so the DIRECT `CONICAL_SURFACE` round-trips watertight too. Native import watertight, vol 522.934 vs OCCT 523.599 rel 1.27e-3, bboxΔ=2.96e-15, faces 6/6. **LANDED — perpendicular `LINE` → native `Plane`:** `c≈0` → a flat `Plane` annulus cap (both endpoints verified to share one axial coordinate). Native import watertight, vol 1568.8 vs OCCT 1570.77 rel 1.25e-3, faces 9/9. **HOST-VERIFIED reduction, end-to-end OCCT fallback — on-axis `CIRCLE`/arc → native `Sphere`:** `revolvedCircle` fires `FaceSurface{Sphere}` (radius = circle radius) iff the centre is ON the axis AND the circle plane contains the axis; asserted at host level equal to the direct `SPHERICAL_SURFACE` import — but watertight end-to-end spheres are NOT yet achievable (the native writer serialises a sphere as three pole-seam lune faces — a WRITER limitation, forbidden to touch — and an OCCT-authored sphere is a single periodic-pole face the reader does not yet reconstruct), so the sim fixture proves the guarantee honestly: the reader DECLINES the OCCT periodic-pole-face sphere and `cc_step_import` falls back to OCCT, vol 904.779 == OCCT rel 0. Flagged, not faked. **HONEST DECLINE → OCCT (no faithful native kind):** an off-axis circle/arc (torus, no `Kind::Torus`; fallback vol 523.599 rel 0), an ellipse / B-spline generatrix (general revolved surface; fallback rel 0), a skew oblique line (hyperboloid), and an on-axis circle whose plane is ⟂ the axis. Each builder re-evaluates the candidate quadric through the generatrix's defining points and DECLINES on a scale-relative mismatch (the "never fabricate geometry" gate; no tolerance weakened). Reader-only change — 4 files (`step_reader.cpp`, `test_native_step_reader.cpp`, `native_step_import_parity.mm`, + the archived change); `step_writer.cpp`, tessellator, `src/engine/**`, and the `cc_*` ABI PRISTINE; `src/native/**` OCCT-free. Does NOT unblock #8 `drop-occt`.
- ✅ **#7 `native-exchange` — STEP IMPORT: a FULL TORUS imports NATIVELY watertight (T1); general/ellipse revolution stays an honest DECLINE (T2).** Closes the last `SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION` surface gap in two honestly-gated tracks (change `add-native-step-torus`, archived `2026-07-07`, validate --strict green; host CTest **29/29** NUMSCI OFF / **36/36** NUMSCI ON, `test_native_step_reader` **36 cases** incl. 2 new torus cases; sim **`[NIMPORT]` 69/69**). **LANDED (T1, genuine native watertight):** a NEW additive `FaceSurface::Kind::Torus` (appended to the enum + a new `minorRadius=0.0` field, so every existing kind is byte-unchanged) now carries a torus. A direct `TOROIDAL_SURFACE` face — and the off-axis-circle `SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION` OCCT itself emits as a `TOROIDAL_SURFACE` — imports as a native `Kind::Torus` solid. Diagnosis showed OCCT bounds a full torus with a FULLY-SEAMED `EDGE_LOOP` (equator v-seam + tube u-seam, each forward AND reversed — no pole, no real trim), so T1 landed through the ALREADY-PROVEN sphere bare-periodic path: the reader detects the all-seam loop and builds a `Kind::Torus` face with a NULL outer wire; the tessellator meshes its natural `(u,v)∈[0,2π]²` rectangle through the UNCHANGED structured-grid path, welding BOTH seams. Host `toroidal_surface_full_torus_imports_watertight` (V=2π²Rr², watertight, ONE Torus face); sim `native torus` parsed=1 watertight=1 solids=1 nativeVol=1771.77 occtVol=1776.53 (rel 2.68e-3), 0 boundary edges (bare doubly-periodic surface — parity asserts volume/area/centroid/face-count + a curved-tessellation-bounded bbox, NOT edge-count, no tolerance weakened). **THE TESSELLATOR WAS NOT TOUCHED beyond a +9-line additive arm:** the ONLY change under `src/native/tessellate/` is `surface_eval.h` (a new `case K::Torus` in `localValue`/`localD1` + a `bounds → {0,2π,0,2π}` arm); **`face_mesher.h` and `trim.h` are NOT in the diff** (more conservative than the planned doubly-periodic seam-weld branch — the sphere path was reused). Existing tessellation is byte-identical by construction (the Torus arm is never evaluated for an existing kind) AND empirically (sphere/cyl/cone/plane revolution faces import byte-identically — `revolution→sphere` vol 902.31 == `sphere_keyword` 902.31, cyl/plane 1568.8, cone 522.934; curved-fillet tris=3912 unchanged; curved-fillet 23 / curved-chamfer 9 / ssi-curved-boolean 21 native-pass=13 / wrap-emboss 6 / run-sim-suite 221 / phase3 70 all match baseline). **T1 HONEST-OUT — a PARTIAL/trimmed torus DECLINES** (the bare-surface route closes watertight only for a fully-seamed full torus; host `toroidal_surface_partial_torus_declines`). **NOT LANDED (T2, honest DECLINE → OCCT retained):** an ELLIPSE / B-spline generatrix revolution keeps the `default → nullopt` decline (imports fine via OCCT). The exact surface is a rational tensor-product B-spline; that reconstruction + watertight self-verify + a capped-solid fixture is a larger, higher-blast-radius change deferred rather than rushed — the per-track gate resolves to DECLINE (sim `foreign revolution decline` parsed=0; OCCT fallback exact rel 0). Additive-only — `shape.h`, `surface_eval.h`, `step_reader.{cpp,h}` + 2 tests; `step_writer.cpp`, `face_mesher.h`, `trim.h`, `src/engine/**`, and the `cc_*` ABI PRISTINE; `src/native/**` OCCT-free. Does NOT unblock #8 `drop-occt`.
- ✅ **#7 `native-exchange` — STEP IMPORT: an ELLIPSE / (non-rational) B-spline generatrix SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION imports NATIVELY as a RATIONAL tensor B-spline surface (the deferred T2, now LANDED).** Closes the LAST `SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION` gap — a GENERAL profile curve that has no analytic-quadric reduction (change `add-native-step-general-revolution`, archived `2026-07-07`, validate --strict green; host CTest **29/29** NUMSCI OFF / **36/36** NUMSCI ON, `test_native_step_reader` **39 cases** incl. 3 new revolution cases; sim **`[NIMPORT]` 77/77**). **PIVOTAL CHECK → POSITIVE (no tessellator change).** The decisive question — does the native `FaceSurface::Kind::BSpline` carry WEIGHTS and does the tessellator mesh a rational surface watertight — resolves YES: `shape.h` ALREADY had `std::vector<double> weights;` (`empty ⇒ non-rational`) on `FaceSurface`, `math/bspline.h` already evaluates rational NURBS, and the existing sphere-style bare-periodic (`VERTEX_LOOP`) mesh path meshes the rational revolved surface watertight — so the honest DECLINE was NOT required and **`shape.h`, `math/**`, and the ENTIRE tessellator are BYTE-UNCHANGED.** **LANDED (genuine native watertight):** the reader revolves the generatrix control net around the axis at the standard revolution knot angles (`0, π/2, π, 3π/2, 2π`) with the standard rational weights (`1, 1/√2, 1, 1/√2, 1`), producing the EXACT rational tensor-product B-spline surface (degree-2 in the revolution direction), maps it onto a native `Kind::BSpline` face carrying those weights with a NULL outer wire (the `advancedFace` bare-periodic arm gains a single `isFullRevolutionBSpline` OR-clause), and the UNCHANGED bare-periodic path meshes it over its natural periodic bounds — welding the seam + degenerate axis poles into a watertight solid. Sim vs OCCT `BRepGProp`: `revolution→ellipsoid` nativeVol 6.6721 vs occtVol 6.70206 (rel **4.47e-3**), area rel 2.06e-3, watertight, 0 boundary edges; `revolution→bspline` nativeVol 130.995 vs 131.342 (rel **2.64e-3**), area rel 1.32e-3, watertight. **HONEST-OUT — an OFF-AXIS ELLIPSE revolution that fails the faithful-reconstruction/watertight self-verify DECLINES → OCCT** (host `revolution_off_axis_ellipse_declines`), as does a skew-line hyperboloid. Reader-only, additive change — `step_reader.{cpp,h}` + 2 tests; `step_writer.cpp`, the tessellator, `shape.h`, `math/**`, `src/engine/**`, and the `cc_*` ABI PRISTINE; `src/native/**` OCCT-free. Because the tessellator is byte-identical, existing meshes are unchanged by construction and the full tessellation-sensitive sim set was correctly not required. Does NOT unblock #8 `drop-occt`.
- ✅ **#4 `native-healing` — FIRST shape-healing slice DONE at BOTH gates (host + sim).** An INTERNAL, OCCT-FREE healer (`cybercad::native::heal::healShell`, `src/native/heal/*`) that stitches a face-soup / malformed shell into a connected, consistently-oriented, WATERTIGHT solid — or reports UNHEALED honestly. Four sub-operations, in dependency order: **vertex/tolerance unification** (the `boolean/assemble.h` `VertexPool` spatial hash generalized to arbitrary B-rep vertices), **tolerant sewing** (an edge becomes shared iff its endpoints unified to the same two shared vertices within tolerance — never a fabricated coincidence), **degenerate removal** (zero-length edges + sliver/near-zero-area faces via a min-height test), and **orientation fix** (flood-fill consistent winding across shared edges + a global enclosed-volume-sign tie-break). Every heal is SELF-VERIFIED (`tessellate::isWatertight` + `enclosedVolume > 0` across a deflection ladder) before it is kept; otherwise a typed `Unhealed` result carries the measured `maxResidualGap` and the ORIGINAL shape UNCHANGED. Gate 1 (host, no OCCT): `test_native_heal` — soup-cube heals to V=1 with `nMergedEdges=12` / `nMergedVerts=16`, a degenerate-edge and a sliver-face are dropped and the cube still heals to V=1, a flipped face is re-oriented (`nFlipped=1`), an all-inward cube triggers the global sign flip, near-coincident vertices unify (and beyond-tol ones never do), and both un-healable fixtures (missing face → `OpenShell`; gap 1e-2 → `GapBeyondTolerance`, residual 0.0255) report UNHEALED with the input unchanged — green under NUMSCI OFF **and** ON. Gate 2 (sim, `run-sim-native-heal.sh`): native-vs-OCCT parity on identical soups — `[NHEAL] 4 passed / 0 failed`: the in-scope soup-cube + flipped-face heal to V=1 matching OCCT `BRepBuilderAPI_Sewing` + `ShapeFix_Shell`/`ShapeFix_Solid` (V=1, valid), and on the beyond-tol / missing-face fixtures the native UNHEALED verdict MATCHES OCCT leaving the shell open (no valid closed solid at the same tolerance). The engine-internal `tryNativeHeal` (`src/engine/native/native_heal_hook.h`) wires native → self-verify → OCCT fallback (`src/engine/occt/occt_shapefix.cpp`); NO `cc_*` entry point, no ABI change, and `src/native/**` stays OCCT-free. **Honest scope (asymptotic, like SSI S4-f):** this slice heals the coincident-within-tolerance / degenerate / orientation defect family EXACTLY — it is a **measured win vs OCCT on the in-scope fixtures, not a guarantee** on arbitrary broken industrial B-rep. Beyond-tolerance gap bridging, missing-pcurve reconstruction, self-intersecting-wire repair, and freeform re-approximation stay OUT OF SCOPE — reported UNHEALED, deferred to OCCT `ShapeFix`, never faked. **Why this is the gating foundation for native STEP IMPORT (#3):** imported B-rep almost always arrives with coincident-within-tolerance shared edges/vertices that are NOT topologically shared, plus degenerate/orientation defects — exactly this healer's in-scope family — so a future native STEP reader can reconstruct topology through this slice and route only the residual (real gaps, missing pcurves, self-intersecting wires) to OCCT. Change `add-native-shape-healing` (7 ADDED requirements / 14 scenarios), archived to `openspec/specs/native-healing`.
- â #8 `drop-occt` â planned; **NOT reachable** at the current native ceiling. Two
  hard, research-grade multi-year dependencies remain: (1) a general robust curved
  boolean / blend kernel (arbitrary surface-surface intersection + shape healing) and
  (2) a FULL native STEP IMPORT (a full AP203/AP214/AP242 parser and B-rep
  reconstructor â the native reader today covers the elementary/B-spline subset,
  flat multi-solid compounds, single-level RIGID/UNIFORM-SCALE/MIRROR placed assemblies,
  AP242 geometry with PMI skipped, a full SPHERE + a full TORUS (TOROIDAL_SURFACE / off-axis-circle
  revolution → native Kind::Torus), the analytic-quadric SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION reductions
  (cyl/cone/plane), and a GENERAL ELLIPSE / non-rational-B-spline generatrix SURFACE_OF_REVOLUTION
  → native rational tensor B-spline Kind::BSpline face (schema-independent,
  AP203/AP214/AP242 headers accepted); non-uniform/shear transforms, deep-nested assemblies,
  PMI semantics, complex/trimmed profiles, a PARTIAL/trimmed torus, and an off-axis-ellipse /
  skew-line-hyperboloid revolution still fall back to OCCT. IGES import/export are DESCOPED — STEP-only). Until BOTH exist, OCCT stays linked
  and Phase 4 stands COMPLETE AT ITS ACHIEVABLE NATIVE CEILING, not fully drop-OCCT.

## Remaining work to drop OCCT â ordered by difficulty (+ effort)

As of the geometry-completion batch, **every tractable/analytic capability is
native**; what remains is the SSI-gated hard core + the exchange/healing track.
Ordered easiest â hardest by *marginal* effort (deps flagged; a cheap item gated
on a hard prereq is not reachable early). Effort is **order-of-magnitude,
robustness-dominated, human-expert-equivalent** â `w` = weeks, `py` = person-years.
LOC are OCCT's (the port/reference size).

Both gate **#8**. **#2 is done** â NumPP/SciPP adopted, generic solvers + native
closest-point verified vs OCCT `Extrema` â so the next critical-path item is **#5 SSI**: its **S1 analytic + S2 subdivision seeding are now DONE**
(S1: 17 elementary pairs closed-form + verified vs OCCT `GeomAPI_IntSS`, `add-native-ssi-analytic`
archived; S2: transversal branch recall 1.00 on freeform/skew-quadric pairs, seeds on both
surfaces ≤ 3.51e-16, `add-native-ssi-seeding`), and what remains is
**S3 marching-line tracer (NEXT, consuming the S2 seeds)** → **S4 tangent-robustness (near-tangent
seed) layer** on top of the substrate (the moat NumPP/SciPP does not buy), feeding the S5
curved-boolean payoff. Total to genuinely drop OCCT â **10â20 py** (a small team, several years); matching
OCCT means re-earning its person-decades of hardening on real CAD data.

### Effort banked so far (human-expert-equivalent)

The native rewrite delivered the entire analytic/tractable surface, verified vs
OCCT: math, topology, watertight tessellation, construction (extrude/revolve/
holed+typed profiles/spline+torus/N-loft/planar+non-planar sweep/threads/shank),
planar + axis-aligned boxâ©cylinder booleans, planar blends, STEP export, and the
**numeric foundations (#2) â NumPP/SciPP adopted as the OCCT-free substrate + native
closest-point/projection verified vs OCCT `Extrema`**. Cumulative â **0.6â0.9 py** of
skilled kernel work, plus the ~**0.15â0.35 py** #2 slice bought largely by adopting
NumPP/SciPP rather than hand-writing the solver layer (a ~60â75% saving on #2).

- **Last batch (geometry-completion) gained â 3â5 person-weeks** â spline edges,
  torus revolve (+ native `Torus`), N-section loft, non-planar RMF sweep â and
  proved the boundary (declines/fallbacks correctly identified, not faked).
- It did **not** shorten the ~10â20 py drop-OCCT tail: that tail is the SSI +
  healing + import hard core, orthogonal to this construction work. By *effort*
  we are ~5â8% of the way to full drop-OCCT; by *tractable-capability breadth*,
  ~complete. The remaining 90%+ is the research-grade core.

Progress is reflected in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) Phase 4 and per-change
`tasks.md`; living specs are synced/archived per capability as they pass the
verification gates.
