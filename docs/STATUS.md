# Status

A single, honest snapshot of what is implemented and **verified**, with the
commands to reproduce it. Nothing here is claimed working unless it was actually
built/run in-repo. Per-phase detail lives in the phase status docs linked below.

_Last updated: 2026-07-06._

## Acceptance bar

The **in-repo iOS-simulator suite** is the acceptance bar: correctness is
asserted against analytic references, GPU results against CPU references, and
B-rep results against validity/watertightness/volume. Physical-device runs and
the CyberCad **app link-swap** are optional, deferred follow-ups — not gates.

## Verified in-repo

| Suite | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Host unit tests (CPU-only, stub + native core) | `ctest` (host build) | **29 / 29** (**36** with `CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI=ON`) — incl. `test_native_heal`, `test_native_step_reader` |
| Full `cc_*` runtime + determinism + benchmark | `scripts/run-sim-suite.sh` | **221 / 221** |
| GPU-vs-CPU parity (Metal), ray + frustum pick | `scripts/run-sim-gpu-suite.sh` | **26 / 26** |
| GPU tessellation wired into `cc_tessellate` | `scripts/run-sim-integ-suite.sh` | **26 / 26** |
| Native features (Phase 3) | `scripts/run-sim-phase3-suite.sh` | **70 / 70** (OCCT wrap-emboss #290 oracle unchanged) |
| Phase-4 native-vs-OCCT parity (math/topology/tessellation/construct/loft/sweep/thread/boolean/curved-boolean/geomcompletion) | `scripts/run-sim-native-*.sh` | all green |
| **#6 CURVED fillet** (circular cylinder↔cap rim → rolling-ball TORUS canal; CONSTANT convex+concave **and** VARIABLE-radius LINEAR-law convex via `cc_fillet_edges_variable`) vs OCCT `BRepFilletAPI` | `scripts/run-sim-native-curved-fillet.sh` | **23 / 23** (15 constant convex+concave controls unchanged + 8 variable). REAL native `activeNative=1`: constant vol rel ≤ 3.8e-3, area rel ≤ 2.1e-3; **variable** watertight, native vol matches its closed-form SWEPT removed volume rel ≤ 1.1e-3 and is DISTINCT from the OCCT evolved oracle (native-vs-OCCT-evolved reported SEPARATELY as a looser O(r′) line rel ≤ 1.2e-2, tol 6e-2), reduced vs sharp cylinder, mesh-vol==B-rep. G1 cos=1.0 at both seams **analytic from the closed-form canal normal, not mesh-sampled** |
| **#6b CURVED chamfer** (CONVEX circular cylinder↔cap rim → CONE-FRUSTUM straight bevel, **C0 NOT G1** — a chamfer is a flat bevel, not a tangent arc) vs OCCT `BRepFilletAPI_MakeChamfer` (`Add(distance, edge)`, symmetric) | `scripts/run-sim-native-curved-chamfer.sh` | **9 / 9** (REAL native `activeNative=1`: because a symmetric chamfer IS exactly a cone frustum, native-vs-OCCT vol rel ≤ 3.25e-3 (angular-deflection-bounded, not a loosened band) **and** matches the exact closed-form Pappus removed volume `π·d²·(Rc − d/3)` rel ≤ 3.25e-3, area rel ≤ 1.61e-3, watertight, mesh-vol==B-rep, reduced vs sharp; bevel normal cos=1/√2 (≈0.70710678) to BOTH the wall and the cap, explicitly **≠1** ⇒ C0 not G1. 3 fixtures Rc=5/d=1, Rc=5/d=2, Rc=4/d=1). Deferred → OCCT: non-circular / asymmetric two-distance / concave / cyl↔cyl chamfer |
| **#7 wrap-emboss** (rectangular pad on a cylinder lateral face) vs OCCT `cc_wrap_emboss` | `scripts/run-sim-native-wrap-emboss.sh` | **6 / 6** (REAL native `activeNative=1`: vol rel ≤ 2.5e-3, area rel ≤ 7.3e-4, watertight, mesh-vol==B-rep, 3 configs) |
| **Shape healing FIRST SLICE** (tolerant sew + vertex/tolerance unify + degenerate removal + orientation fix) vs OCCT `BRepBuilderAPI_Sewing`/`ShapeFix` | `scripts/run-sim-native-heal.sh` | **4 / 4** (in-scope soup-cube + flipped-face heal to V=1 watertight matching OCCT V=1 valid; un-healable → honest UNHEALED matching OCCT: gap 1e-2 → `GapBeyondTolerance` residual 0.0255, missing face → `OpenShell`, both OCCT valid=0 watertight=0; host `test_native_heal` 10/10) |
| **STEP import (native slice, WIDENED)** (OCCT-free Part-21 reader for the elementary/B-spline subset + multi-solid `Compound` + B-spline-FACE round-trip + ELLIPSE-curve recognition + RIGID/UNIFORM-SCALE/MIRROR PLACED ASSEMBLIES + AP203/AP214/AP242 geometry (PMI skipped), healed then self-verified watertight else → OCCT) vs OCCT `STEPControl_Reader` | `scripts/run-sim-native-step-import.sh` | **41 / 41** (native-written box vol rel 2.27e-16, cylinder rel 1.27e-3, holed-plate rel 2.90e-4, all watertight matching OCCT re-import; **FOREIGN OCCT-written box + cylinder imported NATIVELY match OCCT re-import EXACTLY, rel 0**; **multi-solid** foreign 2-solid file imports as a native Compound rel 2.14e-16 per-solid watertight; **B-spline-FACE** native solid round-trips EXACT vol 304.38; **rigid PLACED ASSEMBLY** (transform tree) imports as a native placed Compound — 2-box: 2 solids, vol rel 3.74e-16, bbox Δ=0, faces 12/12; **UNIFORM-SCALE component** via `CARTESIAN_TRANSFORMATION_OPERATOR_3D` scales the placed solid by k³ (k=2: total vol 2728 = 1000 + 216·8, component watertight) — verified against an analytic oracle because OCCT's writer cannot serialize a scaled location (it drops the scale / the iOS OCCT throws "Location with scaling transformation is forbidden"); **MIRROR component** (reflection, det<0) is orientation-complemented so it stays watertight with POSITIVE volume 1216 and reflected bbox; **AP242 file with PMI/GD&T/annotation** imports the SOLID identically to OCCT (vol 1000, bbox Δ=0, faces 6/6) with the semantic PMI + its angle/plane-angle unit contexts SKIPPED (previously fatal → now imports); **AP214** header accepted (schema-independent reader); **ELLIPSE** curve recognised but an ellipse-on-quadric solid still declines → OCCT; **NON-UNIFORM/SHEAR transforms** + **PMI semantics** + **TOROIDAL_SURFACE** + Form-B `MAPPED_ITEM` + deep-nested assemblies decline → OCCT; native path provably exercised — per-face-oriented edge counts, not OCCT's unique count; host `test_native_step_reader` 20/20) |

| Spec validation | `openspec validate --all --strict` | **30 / 30** |

Highlights (measured, not asserted-trivially):

- **Determinism:** parallel booleans + meshing are **bit-identical** to serial
  (mesh hash + exact volume + tri count), stable across 8 runs.
- **Thread boolean (#286):** fine multi-turn fuse/cut completes in **~4.3–4.4 s**
  (< 8 s budget), valid + watertight — no minutes-long OCCT hang.
- **GPU tessellation:** box routes 6/6 faces to the GPU (area 600.000004 vs OCCT
  600.000000); holed slab routes 4 GPU / 3 OCCT-fallback, bbox+area+volume match.
- **G2 fillet (#284):** measured seam curvature gap **0.0188** (≤ 0.05 tol) vs
  stock G1 baseline **0.31** — a real, measured curvature improvement.

## Open / deferred (honest)

- **Phase 2 spatial tail:** GPU **frustum-pick** parity + **repeat-run
  determinism** now VERIFIED on the sim (GPU pick suite 26/26; frustum set == CPU
  set, sorted ascending, byte-identical ×8 for ray + frustum). The only remaining
  item is the **OPTIONAL additive `cc_*` pick/cull facade entry** (app-facing, out
  of scope — no OCCT-side pick path exists in the facade today).
- **Full-round fillet (#285):** rolling-ball blend proven for ALL planar walls
  (parallel AND non-parallel dihedral — non-parallel fixture n_L·n_R=-0.7241,
  43.60°, G1 cos=1.000000, middle consumed, valid+watertight). Only truly CURVED
  (non-planar) neighbours fall back to a valid standard fillet, by design.
- **G2 fillet (#284):** non-straight seams defer to a standard fillet.
- **Thread boolean determinism:** reproducible within rel 2e-4, not bit-exact
  (parallel `BOPAlgo`).
- **On-device runs** (physical Apple silicon) and the **CyberCad app link-swap**
  — verified/derived on the simulator only; both optional by the acceptance bar.
