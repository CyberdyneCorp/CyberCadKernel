// bspline_gordon.h — NURBS roadmap Layer 6: GORDON / NETWORK surface (a surface
// through a NETWORK of curves in BOTH parameter directions).
//
// Given a NETWORK of `K` u-direction curves `{C_k(u)}` and `L` v-direction curves
// `{D_l(v)}` that INTERSECT at a `K × L` grid of points `Q_{k,l}`, construct a single
// tensor-product B-spline SURFACE that INTERPOLATES every network curve — the surface
// contains every `C_k` as the iso-curve `S(·, v_k)` and every `D_l` as the iso-curve
// `S(u_l, ·)`. This is the "curve network → smooth skin" direction of freeform
// surfacing (docs/NURBS-SCOPE.md §2/§4 Layer 6): skinning interpolates ONE family of
// parallel sections; a Gordon surface interpolates TWO transversal families at once.
//
// It sits above the evaluators in bspline.{h,cpp} and COMPOSES lower layers:
//   * Layer 1 (bspline_ops.h) — degree elevation / knot refinement make the three
//     tensor-product summand surfaces COMPATIBLE (raise to a common degree, merge to
//     the union knot vector) EXACTLY, so their control nets can be added/subtracted.
//   * Layer 6 (bspline_skin.h) — `skinSurface` skins each direction's family of curves;
//     the compatibility machinery `makeSectionsCompatible` normalizes each family.
//   * Layer 7 (bspline_fit.h) — `interpolateSurface` builds the tensor-product
//     interpolant `T` of the `K × L` intersection grid (collocation + `lin_solve`).
//
// Clean-room from *The NURBS Book* (Piegl & Tiller, 2nd ed.), §10.5 — the Gordon
// surface as a BOOLEAN SUM (Coons/Gordon combination):
//
//     G = S_u ⊕ S_v ⊖ T
//
//   where
//     S_u = the lofted (skinned) surface INTERPOLATING the K u-curves `C_k` across v,
//     S_v = the lofted (skinned) surface INTERPOLATING the L v-curves `D_l` across u,
//     T   = the tensor-product surface INTERPOLATING the K×L intersection grid `Q_{k,l}`.
//
// The three summands are brought to a COMMON tensor-product basis (common degrees
// (p,q), common knot vectors in u and v) by the exact Layer-1 ops, after which the
// Gordon net is the pointwise `poles(S_u) + poles(S_v) − poles(T)`. Because the
// boolean sum is the classic Coons/Gordon cancellation, the result interpolates every
// input network curve: on `v = v_k`, `S_u` reduces to `C_k`, and `S_v − T` cancels
// (both reduce to the same interpolant of `Q_{k,·}`), so `G(·, v_k) = C_k`; and
// symmetrically `G(u_l, ·) = D_l`.
//
// NETWORK CONSISTENCY (the honest precondition): the boolean sum only interpolates the
// network when the curves actually form a consistent grid — the u-curve `C_k` evaluated
// at the v-curve station `u_l` must equal the v-curve `D_l` evaluated at `v_k`, both
// equal to the grid point `Q_{k,l}`, to within tolerance. `verifyNetwork` checks this;
// `gordonSurface` DECLINES (`ok = false`, with a reason) on an inconsistent or
// degenerate network — it never emits a surface that silently misses its own curves.
//
// SCOPE — NON-RATIONAL network (`gordonSurface`) PLUS the RATIONAL (weighted) network
// (`gordonRationalSurface`): the u/v section curves carry weights, and the whole boolean sum
// — the two skins and the tensor grid interpolant — is formed in HOMOGENEOUS (wx,wy,wz,w) space
// (the same rational-skin / rational-fit lift), then projected back to a rational surface. The
// weight coordinate is interpolated and combined exactly like x/y/z, so the rational Gordon
// surface CONTAINS every rational network curve pointwise. IRREGULAR / N-sided networks (non-grid
// topologies, trimmed boundaries) and the exact BRepFill/GeomFill residual are documented
// residuals for later slices — this module never fakes them. See docs/NURBS-SCOPE.md Layer-6 row.
//
// GUARD — the construction composes `skinSurface` / `interpolateSurface`, which solve
// linear systems through the numsci facade, so the whole implementation TU is under
// CYBERCAD_HAS_NUMSCI (exactly like bspline_skin.cpp / bspline_fit.cpp). With the guard
// OFF the TU is inert and the functions are absent; the declarations remain visible for
// documentation.
//
// OCCT-FREE. clang++ -std=c++20. fp64, deterministic.
